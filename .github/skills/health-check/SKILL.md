# Health Check Skill

## Trigger
"Check my setup" / "Is my forge healthy?" / "Run health check" / "Diagnose my project"

## Steps

### 1. Environment Diagnostics
Use the `forge_smith` MCP tool to inspect the forge — diagnose environment, VS Code config, setup health, version currency, and common problems.

Review the output for:
- Required tools installed (git, VS Code, PowerShell/Bash, gh CLI)
- VS Code settings for Copilot agent mode
- .forge.json validity and version currency
- MCP server status
- Orchestrator readiness

> **If forge_smith reports failures**: List each failure with its FIX recommendation. Continue to Step 2 regardless.

### 2. Setup Validation
Use the `forge_validate` MCP tool (or run `pforge check`) to verify that all required Plan Forge files exist, file counts match preset expectations, and no unresolved placeholders remain.

Review the output for:
- Required files present (instructions, agents, prompts, skills)
- File counts match preset expectations
- No unresolved `TimeTracker` placeholders
- AGENTS.md and copilot-instructions.md configured

> **If validate reports missing files**: Flag as CRITICAL — setup may need to be re-run.

### 3. Completeness Scan
Use the `forge_sweep` MCP tool to scan code files for TODO, FIXME, HACK, stub, placeholder, and mock data markers.

Review the output for:
- Count of deferred-work markers
- Location of each marker
- Whether markers are in production code vs. test/config files

> **If sweep finds markers in production code**: Flag as WARNING — these should be resolved before the Review Gate (Step 5).

### 4. Report

```
Plan Forge Health Check:
  Environment:   N passed, N failed, N warnings
  Setup:         N passed, N failed
  Sweep:         N deferred-work markers found

  Critical Issues: (list any)
  Warnings:        (list any)
  Recommendations: (list any)

  Overall: PASS / FAIL
```

A PASS requires:
- Zero environment failures (warnings OK)
- Zero setup failures
- Zero sweep markers in production code (markers in tests/config are OK)

## Safety Rules
- This skill is READ-ONLY — do NOT modify any files
- Report findings clearly with actionable fix recommendations
- Distinguish between critical issues (must fix) and warnings (should fix)

## Persistent Memory (if OpenBrain is configured)

- **Before checking**: `search_thoughts("setup issue", project: "TimeTracker", created_by: "copilot-vscode", type: "bug")` — load prior setup issues and recurring health check failures
- **After check**: `capture_thought("Health check: <summary of findings>", project: "TimeTracker", created_by: "copilot-vscode", source: "skill-health-check")` — persist environment issues for future diagnostics
