# Step 2: Harden the Plan

> **Pipeline**: Step 2 of 5 (Session 1 — Plan Hardening)
> **When**: After pre-flight passes (Step 1)
> **Model suggestion**: Claude (best at structured plan generation and scope contract design)
> **Next Step**: `step3-execute-slice.prompt.md` (new session)

> ⚠️ **Do not harden plans with headless `gh copilot`** (meta-bug [#86](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/86)).
> `gh copilot` in `-p` / `--autopilot` mode runs in a sandboxed session that cannot write to your
> repository regardless of the flags you pass (`--allow-all`, `--allow-all-tools --allow-all-paths
> --no-ask-user`, `--yolo --no-ask-user` all fail the same way). The CLI will either exit 1 with
> `Permission denied and could not request permission from user`, or exit 0 with the edits written
> to `~/.copilot/session-state/<sid>/files/` instead of your repo.
>
> **Use interactive hardening instead**: open this prompt in VS Code Copilot chat (agent mode),
> or call `forge_master_ask` with `mode: "harden"`. Both can write to the workspace directly.

Replace `<YOUR-PLAN>` with your plan filename (without path or `.md` extension).

---

Read these files first:
1. docs/plans/AI-Plan-Hardening-Runbook.md
2. docs/plans/<YOUR-PLAN>.md
3. docs/plans/DEPLOYMENT-ROADMAP.md
4. .github/copilot-instructions.md

**Prior lessons — enumerate, do not guess filenames.** List everything in
`/memories/repo/` and read what looks relevant to this plan's subject. Then search
memory as well: `forge_search` with `sources: ["memory"]`, or `brain_recall` if
OpenBrain is configured.

Do not look for a fixed set of filenames. Memory files are named by subject —
`plan-gate-command-rules.md`, `release-procedure.md`, `orchestrator-cross-repo-launch.md` —
because one unbounded append-only `lessons-learned.md` is unreadable. A hardener that
checks three catch-all names reports "no prior lessons exist" while sitting on top of a
directory full of them (meta-bug [#257](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/257)).

Report what you searched and what you found, not what you failed to open:

> Searched 12 files in `/memories/repo/` + memory for "gate portability", "windows shim".
> Applied: `plan-gate-portability-old-consumers.md` (Slice 3 gate rewritten).
> Nothing relevant for the migration slices.

"Searched N files + memory, nothing relevant" is a finding. "No prior lessons exist"
is a claim you cannot make from a missing filename.

Every query you record must be one you actually ran — a query phrased in code
identifiers scores 0 and is indistinguishable from an empty store, so an unrun query
looks exactly like a genuine absence.

**Prior plan postmortems (Phase-25 L5 closed loop)**:
Before hardening, also scan `.forge/plans/<plan-basename>/postmortem-*.json` for
the plan you are hardening (same basename as the draft). If any exist, read the
newest 3 and factor them into the Scope Contract:

- If `retriesPerSlice` shows a slice that flapped 3+ times, strengthen its
  validation gate or split it into smaller slices.
- If `gateFlaps > 0` on multiple prior runs, your gate commands are unstable —
  replace grep/pipe-based gates with allowlisted node assertions.
- If `topFailureReason` repeats across postmortems, add a mitigation in the
  current plan's Risks section and reference the prior failure.
- If `costDelta.delta` trends upward across runs, flag a budget risk in the
  plan's Budget section.
- If no postmortems exist, note "No prior postmortems — first execution."

This is a READ of the postmortems — do NOT modify them. Pure signal for the
hardener.

Now act as a PLAN HARDENING AGENT (see the Plan Hardening Prompt in the runbook).

**CLARIFICATION CHECK**: Before hardening, scan the plan for `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers.
If any exist, list them all and wait for the user to resolve them before proceeding.

Harden <YOUR-PLAN>.md by adding all 6 Mandatory Template Blocks from the runbook:
- Scope Contract (in-scope, out-of-scope, forbidden actions)
- Required Decisions (flag anything implicit as TBD)
- Acceptance Criteria (use **MUST**: and **SHOULD**: prefixes for each criterion — the analyzer scores these)
- Execution Slices (30-120 min each, with Depends On + Context Files + Parallelism tag)
- Re-anchor Checkpoints
- Definition of Done (must include Reviewer Gate checkbox)
- Stop Conditions

**IMPORTANT**: Format Acceptance Criteria as:
```
- **MUST**: Description of required criterion
- **SHOULD**: Description of recommended criterion
```
Do NOT use `- [ ]` checkbox format — the analyzer cannot score checkboxes as effectively.

For each Execution Slice:
- Tag as [parallel-safe] (with Parallel Group) or [sequential]
- Include relevant .github/instructions/*.instructions.md files in Context Files
- List only instruction files whose domain matches the slice (not all 17 — each consumes context budget)
- Add a Parallel Merge Checkpoint after each parallel group
- **Validation gates MUST be executable commands**, not prose descriptions:
  - **Good**: `**Validation Gate**:\n\`\`\`bash\ndotnet test\n\`\`\``
  - **Good**: `**Validation Gate**: \`dotnet build\``
  - **Bad**: `**Validation Gate**: Files compile, DTOs have correct properties`
  - **Bad**: a ` ```text ` (or ` ```ts `, ` ```json `) fence under the gate marker — only shell-tagged or untagged fences are executed; gate lint rejects a declared gate that parses to no command (meta-bug [#281](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/281))
  - For manual checks that can't be automated, prefix with `[manual]`: `**Validation Gate**: [manual] UI layout matches mockup`
- **Write each slice's tasks as a numbered list** (`1. …`, `2. …`). The worker prompt receives only numbered items — bullet or prose instructions, including a `**Goal**` paragraph, never reach the worker, and gate lint warns about slices with none

Do NOT add features or expand scope. Only structure what already exists.

After hardening, run a TBD RESOLUTION SWEEP:
1. Scan Required Decisions for TBD entries.
2. Resolve using context from the plan, roadmap, and guardrails.
3. If a TBD requires human judgment, list it and ask the user.
4. Wait for all TBDs to be resolved before finalizing.

Also validate parallelism tags:
- Are [parallel-safe] slices truly independent (no shared files)?
- Are Parallel Merge Checkpoints present after each parallel group?

After all sections are drafted, run a **PLAN QUALITY SELF-CHECK** before outputting:

1. Does every Execution Slice have at least one validation gate with an exact command?
2. Does every [parallel-safe] slice avoid touching files shared by other slices in the same group?
3. Are all REQUIRED DECISIONS resolved (no TBD remaining)?
4. Does the Definition of Done include "Reviewer Gate passed (zero 🔴 Critical)"?
5. Do the Stop Conditions cover: build failure, test failure, scope violation, and security breach?
6. Does every slice list only the instruction files relevant to its domain (not all 17)?
7. Are MUST acceptance criteria from the spec traceable to at least one slice's validation gate?
8. Do all validation gate commands pass the **Gate Portability Rules** below?
9. For every slice touching `.ts`/`.tsx` files, does its gate include a typecheck step (not just a test run)? Are test gates scoped to the changed module rather than the whole workspace suite?
10. Has every **factual claim about existing code** been verified against the codebase? (See Premise Verification below.)
11. **Can every gate actually FAIL?** Prove it against the absent thing before trusting it. (See Gate Failability below.)
12. Does everything the plan names actually **exist as a file** — gate scripts, cited helpers, fixtures? Check with `git ls-files`, not just the filesystem: a helper that is gitignored and untracked is absent from the very worktree the plan mandates.
13. If the plan declares an isolated branch or worktree, does it carry **bootstrap steps** plus a confirm-before-Slice-1 check? With workspace package builds uncommitted, the first gate of the first slice fails on unresolvable imports and reads as a genuine stop condition rather than an unbuilt workspace. Treat any recorded baseline SHA as a hardening record, not a branch point.

### Gate Failability

A gate that cannot fail is worse than no gate: it reports success forever and nobody
looks again. Item 1 asks whether a gate *exists*; this asks whether it can return
non-zero when the thing it checks is missing.

**Test it the only way that works — run it against the absent thing** and confirm a
non-zero exit, then against the present thing and confirm zero. Two measured traps
from meta-bug [#258](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/258):

| Trap | Why it passes | Fix |
|------|---------------|-----|
| `vitest run <path>` on a path that matches nothing | On vitest 2.x/3.x prints "No test files found" and **exits 0**. A TDD gate naming the test file its own slice is meant to create therefore passes at the red step, and keeps passing if the test is never written. Version-dependent: vitest 4 exits 1. | Add `--passWithNoTests=false`, and verify the exit code on your installed version rather than assuming. |
| `pnpm --filter <pkg> <script>` where the script does not exist | Prints "None of the selected packages has a ... script" and **exits 0**, so a typo or a script that only lives in a sibling package reads as a passing gate. | `pnpm run <script>` from inside the package directory — exits 1 with `ERR_PNPM_NO_SCRIPT`. |

The gate linter flags the `pnpm --filter` form mechanically. It deliberately does not
flag the vitest form, because the behaviour depends on the installed version — that
one is yours to check.

Same family: a gate counting brand-new files with `git diff --name-only HEAD~N` reads 0,
because that never lists untracked files and the slice cannot commit on an unrun gate.
Use `git status --porcelain` or `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`.

And check the other direction: a gate asserting a count is `>= 1` is already satisfied if
something pre-existing matches its glob. Run the gate on a clean tree **before** the
slice writes anything; if it passes there, it is measuring history, not your work.

**A gate must also be able to PASS.** Meta-bug [#256](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/256)
halted a slice on a gate that forbade `ALTER TABLE` in a migration — while the plan
mandated five foreign keys, and Prisma emits every foreign key as
`ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ... FOREIGN KEY`, even for a table created in the same
migration. The plan required a schema whose migration its own gate forbade. Before
forbidding a string, confirm the tool that generates the file does not always emit it.

**If the slice claims a red step, prove the red step exists.** A TDD contract asserting
"this slice breaks the two suites that assert the old shape" is a factual claim about
current behaviour, same as any other premise. Run those suites first. In #256 both were
measured identical before and after, so the slice had no red step available inside its
declared file list — and an executor following the contract waits for a failure that
cannot happen.

### Premise Verification

A plan's Non-Goals, Assumptions, and slice descriptions routinely assert facts about
code that already exists — "all 17 endpoints exist and are tested", "the list endpoint
already supports filtering", "this component is already wired to the store". These
assertions become the *scope boundary*: a slice that builds on a false premise is
scoped against a surface that does not exist, and the executor discovers it mid-slice.

Meta-bug [#237](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/237): a plan's Non-Goals
said "No new API endpoints. All 17 exist and are tested." The target route file
contained only `POST /:entryId/approve` and `POST /:entryId/deny` — the list endpoint
Slice 1 depended on was never there. Nobody had opened the file.

**Before finalizing, extract every such assertion and check it.** Verification is a
`grep_search` or a `read_file` — not an inference from the spec, the roadmap, or a
sibling module's shape.

| Assertion shape | How to verify |
|-----------------|---------------|
| "N endpoints/components/tables exist" | Read the route/index/schema file and count. Put the real number in the plan. |
| "X already supports Y" | Find the symbol and confirm Y is in its signature or body. |
| "X is already tested" | Locate the test file and confirm it asserts the behaviour, not just that X imports. |
| "No new <thing> needed" | Confirm every `<thing>` the slices consume resolves to existing code. |

Rules:
- If an assertion is **false**, correct the plan text and re-scope the affected slice.
  A false Non-Goal is a scope defect, not a wording problem.
- If an assertion **cannot be verified** (external service, unavailable repo), demote
  it from Non-Goals to a **Required Decision** with an explicit owner. Never leave an
  unverifiable claim standing as a scope boundary.
- Cite the file you checked in the plan's Assumptions section so the reviewer can
  re-run the check.

### Gate Portability Rules

Gate commands run via `execSync` on the host OS — on Windows this means `cmd.exe`, not bash.
Every gate command MUST be cross-platform. Apply these rules when writing gates:

> **Windows + Git for Windows note**: If the user has Git for Windows installed, the orchestrator
> auto-wraps gate commands that contain Unix-shell syntax (`grep`, `test`, `sed`, `awk`, `cat`, etc.)
> in `bash -c "..."` automatically. In that case, Unix-shell gates work fine. Without Git for Windows,
> only `node`, `npx`, and `npm` commands are safe in gates on Windows — use `node -e` one-liners
> for all non-vitest checks.

| Rule | Bad | Good |
|------|-----|------|
| **No Unix-only commands** | `grep -c "foo" file.md` | `node -e "const c=require('fs').readFileSync('file.md','utf8');if(!c.includes('foo'))throw new Error('missing');console.log('ok');"` |
| **No `/dev/stdin`** | `curl ... \| node -e "...readFileSync('/dev/stdin',...)"` | `readFileSync(0,'utf8')` for fd 0, or move to vitest |
| **No `/tmp/` or `/dev/null`** | `echo '{}' > /tmp/test.json` | `node -e "require('fs').writeFileSync(require('os').tmpdir()+'/test.json','{}')"` |
| **No pipe to grep** | `git status \| grep -c "Ignored"` | `node -e "const{execSync}=require('child_process');const o=execSync('git status',{encoding:'utf8'});..."` |
| **No `//` comments in `node -e`** | `node -e "const x=1; // comment"` | Remove comments — `//` swallows the rest of a one-liner |
| **No `--grep` with vitest** | `npx vitest run --grep "pattern"` | Run the full suite: `bash -c "cd pforge-mcp && npx vitest run tests/server.test.mjs"` |
| **No `pforge` CLI in gates** | `pforge runbook plan.md` | `pwsh ./pforge.ps1 runbook plan.md` or rewrite as `node -e` |
| **No `pforge analyze` in gates** | `pforge analyze docs/plans/Phase-X.md` | Omit — the orchestrator auto-runs analyze post-execution. Use `pforge regression-guard <plan>` if you need a doc-integrity gate. `pforge analyze` exits 1 on noisy text-match coverage heuristics and reliably false-negatives Slice 5 recursive-hardening gates (observed on Phases 38.1-38.8). |
| **No multi-line `node -e`** | `node -e "\n import(...)...\n"` | Collapse to single line |
| **No `cat FILE`** | `cat VERSION` | `node -e "console.log(require('fs').readFileSync('VERSION','utf8').trim())"` |
| **`npx vitest` from project root** | `npx vitest run` (picks up wrong version) | `bash -c "cd pforge-mcp && npx vitest run"` |
| **curl localhost:* in non-final slices** | `curl http://localhost:3100/api/...` | Move runtime API checks to vitest integration tests |
| **No nested escaped quotes inside `bash -c "..."`** (meta-bug [#93](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/93)) | `bash -c "grep -q onclick=\"forgeMasterPickPrompt\" file.html"` — collapses on Windows `cmd → bash` with `/bin/bash: -c: line 1: unexpected EOF while looking for matching quote` | Use single quotes inside double: `bash -c "grep -q onclick='forgeMasterPickPrompt' file.html"`, OR move to `node -e` with `.includes()`, OR rely on an existing vitest test that already proves the absence/presence. Never stack three levels of escapes (`\\\"`) — they survive some quoting layers and break on others. |
| **Don't wrap allowlisted tools in `bash -c`** (meta-bug [#171](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/171)) | `bash -c "pwsh -NoProfile -File pforge.ps1 ..."`, `bash -c "node script.mjs"`, `bash -c "npx vitest run"` — `where bash` resolves to WSL bash on Windows, which has no Windows PATH; `pwsh`/`node`/`npx` calls inside fail with `command not found`. Empirically bit Phase GITHUB-B and Phase CRUCIBLE-IMPORT-CLI. | Call the allowlisted tool directly: `pwsh -NoProfile -File pforge.ps1 ...`, `node script.mjs`, `npx vitest run`. The orchestrator auto-routes commands containing pipes or shell-chains through Git Bash. **Only use `bash -c` when you genuinely need bash semantics**: heredocs, `cd dir && cmd` (because `cd` chains through `&&`), or multi-tool pipelines where the wrapping is explicit. As of v2.93.1, `runGate` also routes literal `bash -c` gates through Git Bash, but authoring the bare command is still preferred. |
| **TypeScript gates MUST include a typecheck** (meta-bug [#234](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/234)) | `pnpm --filter @app/api test` alone — vitest/jest run through esbuild/swc, which **strip types without type-checking**, so a slice can go green while shipping code that does not compile (`TS2322`, etc.). | Pair the test gate with a typecheck: `bash -c "cd api && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test <module>"` or `bash -c "cd api && npx tsc --noEmit && npx vitest run <module>"`. For any slice that touches `.ts`/`.tsx` files, a typecheck gate is **mandatory**, not optional. |
| **Scope test gates to the changed module, not the whole workspace** (meta-bug [#234](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/234)) | `pnpm --filter @app/web test` (whole suite) — a slice can never pass while ANY pre-existing unrelated test in the workspace is red, coupling the slice to failures it did not cause. | Target the slice's own test file/module: `bash -c "cd web && npx vitest run src/features/campaigns"`. Keep the gate's pass/fail tied to the code the slice actually changed. |

**Preferred gate pattern** (covers 90% of slices):
```bash
node pforge-mcp/server.mjs --check
node -e "process.chdir('pforge-mcp'); require('child_process').execSync('npx vitest run tests/server.test.mjs', {stdio:'inherit',shell:true});"
```

> Do **not** write `bash -c "cd pforge-mcp && npx vitest run ..."`. It looks cleaner but earns two
> linter warnings per slice — `'bash -c' prefix detected` and `'cd dir && command' chain` — because
> `bash` is not guaranteed on Windows PATH and `cd &&` does not persist under cmd.exe. The `node -e`
> form above dispatches through the allowlisted `node` binary, needs no shell, and lints clean
> ([#247](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/247)). Reserve `bash -c` for genuine
> heredoc cases.

> Use `--check`, not `--validate`. `--validate` **regenerates** `tools.json` and `cli-schema.json`, so using it as a gate mutates tracked source and the orchestrator's auto-commit sweeps the change into an unrelated slice (meta-bug [#240](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/240)). `--check` verifies the same artifacts read-only and exits non-zero on drift. Regenerate deliberately with `--validate` when you actually change the tool surface.

Add additional `node -e` checks only when the vitest suite doesn't cover a specific validation (e.g., checking a file exists, verifying an export).

If any check fails, revise the plan before outputting. Do not present a plan that fails its own quality check.

**After hardening, run the automated gate linter** (if `forge_analyze` or the orchestrator is available):
```
node --input-type=module -e "import{lintGateCommands}from'./pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs';const r=lintGateCommands('<plan-file>');console.log(r.summary);r.errors.forEach(e=>console.log('ERR:',e.message));r.warnings.forEach(w=>console.log('WARN:',w.message));"
```
Fix all errors **and** warnings before declaring the plan hardened. The same lint runs as a pre-flight
check in `runPlan()` — errors will block execution, and in strict mode
(`PFORGE_GATE_LINT_STRICT=1`) portability warnings are promoted to errors too.

A clean plan really is achievable: `lintGateCommands` is quote-aware as of
[#246](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/246), so shell metacharacters inside the JS you
hand to `node -e` (a `|` in a regex, an `||`, a `.test.mjs` path) no longer trip the shell-shape rules.
Phase-51, -54 and -60 all lint at 0/0/0. If you see a warning, treat it as real.

Finally, run a **SESSION BUDGET CHECK**:

- Count total slices
- If 8+ slices: recommend a session break point (e.g., "Plan for a session break after Slice N —
  commit progress, start a new session, resume from Slice N+1")
- If any single slice has 5+ Context Files: flag it and suggest trimming to the 3 most relevant

Output a TBD summary:
| # | Decision | Status | Resolution |
|---|----------|--------|------------|

If ALL TBDs resolved: "Plan hardened ✅ — proceed to Step 3 (Execute Slices)"
If ANY need input: list them and WAIT.

---

## lockHash — Drift Protection (A6)

After all sections are finalized and the plan quality self-check passes, compute and insert the `lockHash` into the plan's frontmatter as the **final hardening action**:

1. Compute the hash using `computeLockHash(planContent)` from `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs`:
   ```bash
   node -e "import('./pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs').then(m=>require('fs').promises.readFile('<PLAN_PATH>','utf-8').then(c=>console.log(m.computeLockHash(c))))"
   ```
   Or invoke from the orchestrator:
   ```bash
   node --input-type=module -e "
   import { computeLockHash } from './pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs';
   import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
   const c = readFileSync('<PLAN_PATH>', 'utf-8');
   console.log(computeLockHash(c));
   "
   ```

2. Add or replace the `lockHash:` field in the plan's YAML frontmatter (the `---` block at the top):
   ```yaml
   ---
   lockHash: <computed-hex>
   ---
   ```

3. **Do NOT re-compute the hash after inserting it.** The orchestrator strips frontmatter before hashing, so the `lockHash` field itself is excluded from the hash input. Inserting it does not change the computed value.

4. **Template-only change**: this step does NOT retroactively re-harden plans that are already running. A plan without `lockHash` runs exactly as before (backwards-compatible).

5. If any slice Scope, Validation Gate, or Forbidden Actions content changes after the lockHash is written, you MUST re-compute and update the lockHash before the plan can execute.

---

## Retro / Closure Slice — Status-Header Rewrite (meta-bug [#212](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/212))

The final slice of a hardened plan (typically `S<N>` named "Retro", "Closure", or "Phase closure")
appends a `## What actually shipped` section to the plan file. That section alone is **not enough**
— the plan's top-of-file status block stays stale (`status: HARDENED — awaiting Execution Hold lift`,
or `> **Status**: in-progress`) and misleads anyone scanning the directory for what's done versus
what's still running.

The retro slice MUST also rewrite the plan's status header in the same commit:

1. **YAML frontmatter** (if present): change `status:` from `HARDENED` / `in-progress` / `running`
   to `complete` (or `shipped`). Example:
   ```yaml
   ---
   status: complete
   shippedAt: 2026-MM-DD
   shippedIn: vX.Y.Z
   lockHash: <unchanged>
   ---
   ```

2. **Quote-block status line** (first line after the title): rewrite from
   `> **Status**: HARDENED — awaiting Execution Hold lift` (or similar)
   to
   `> **Status**: ✅ Complete. All <N> slices shipped. See [What actually shipped](#what-actually-shipped) for the retro.`

3. **Validation gate for the retro slice MUST include both checks**, not just the retro-section check:
   ```bash
   node -e "const c=require('fs').readFileSync('docs/plans/<YOUR-PLAN>.md','utf8'); if(!c.includes('## What actually shipped'))throw new Error('retro section missing'); if(!/^>\\s*\\*\\*Status\\*\\*:\\s*(✅|Complete)/m.test(c))throw new Error('status header not rewritten to Complete'); console.log('ok retro+status');"
   ```

4. Do NOT change `lockHash` during the retro — the retro slice runs AFTER all gated work and is
   permitted to mutate only the status header, the `## What actually shipped` section, and the
   `Progress tracker` checkboxes. Re-hashing here would break the orchestrator's drift detection
   for any in-flight retries.

This rule applies to every hardened plan with a retro/closure slice. If a plan has no explicit
retro slice, the shipper (`pforge ship` / `step6-ship.prompt.md`) is responsible for the same
status-header rewrite at tag time.

---

## Release-Slice Hardening (when the plan ships a tag)

If any slice contains `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` or creates a git tag, that slice
is a **release slice** and MUST include these gates verbatim (meta-bug #129):

```bash
# 1. Refuse to release if the target tag already exists on origin.
git ls-remote --tags origin "refs/tags/v$VERSION" | grep -q . && {
  echo "FATAL: tag v$VERSION already exists on origin — refusing to release"
  exit 1
} || true

# 2. Refuse to retrograde the version (target must be > latest shipped tag).
LATEST=$(git ls-remote --tags origin 'refs/tags/v[0-9]*' | \
  awk -F/ '{print $NF}' | sort -V | tail -1 | sed 's/^v//')
node -e "
  const a='$VERSION'.split('.').map(Number);
  const b='$LATEST'.split('.').map(Number);
  for (let i=0;i<3;i++){if((a[i]||0)>(b[i]||0))process.exit(0);if((a[i]||0)<(b[i]||0))process.exit(1);}
  process.exit(1);
" || { echo "FATAL: v$VERSION is not strictly greater than latest v$LATEST"; exit 1; }
```

The orchestrator now also runs this as a **preflight** check on the plan
filename / frontmatter / `chore(release)` line — see
`detectVersionCollision()` in orchestrator.mjs. The plan-level gate above is
a defense-in-depth backup; both must pass.

If the plan intentionally re-tags a shipped version (almost never), the
operator must pass `--allow-retrograde` to bypass the orchestrator preflight,
and the plan must include a Stop Condition explaining why.

## Persistent Memory (if OpenBrain is configured)

- **Before hardening**: `search_thoughts("<phase topic>", project: "TimeTracker", created_by: "copilot-vscode")` — load prior decisions, patterns, and post-mortem lessons that inform scope and slicing
- **During TBD resolution**: `search_thoughts("<ambiguous topic>", project: "TimeTracker", created_by: "copilot-vscode", type: "decision")` — check if prior decisions already resolve the ambiguity
- **After hardening**: `capture_thought("Plan hardened: <phase name> — N slices, key decisions: ...", project: "TimeTracker", created_by: "copilot-vscode", source: "plan-forge-step-2-hardening", type: "decision")` — persist hardening decisions for the execution session
