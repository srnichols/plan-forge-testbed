# Step 6: Ship

> **Pipeline**: Step 6 of 6 (Session 4 — Ship)
> **When**: After the Review Gate passes (Step 5)
> **Model suggestion**: Any model / Copilot Auto (10% token savings) — commit, roadmap update, and postmortem are straightforward
> **Prerequisite**: Step 5 verdict must be **PASS**

Replace `<YOUR-HARDENED-PLAN>` with your hardened plan filename.

---

Read these files first:
1. docs/plans/<YOUR-HARDENED-PLAN>.md (Definition of Done + Execution Slices)
2. docs/plans/DEPLOYMENT-ROADMAP.md
3. .github/instructions/git-workflow.instructions.md

> **Plan Forge maintainers shipping a framework release** (i.e., bumping the `pforge` version itself, not just closing a project phase): follow [docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md](../../docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md) instead of this prompt. The checklist covers VERSION/package.json sync, hooks mirror, instruction enumeration, the mandatory `gh release create` step, and bump-back-to-dev.

Now act as a SHIPPING AGENT. The Review Gate has passed — your job is to finalize and close out this phase.

---

### 1. VERIFY REVIEW PASSED

Confirm that the Review Gate (Step 5) issued a **PASS** verdict.
If the verdict was LOCKOUT or unknown, direct me back to Step 5 before proceeding.

### 2. COMMIT

1. Run `git status` — list all changed/created files
2. Run `git diff --stat` — summarize scope of changes
3. Read the hardened plan's phase name and goal
4. Generate a conventional commit message:
   - Type: `feat` / `fix` / `refactor` (based on phase type)
   - Scope: derived from phase name
   - Body: list execution slices completed
5. Show the proposed commit message and **ask for confirmation**
6. Run `git add -A` then `git commit -m "<message>"`

### 3. UPDATE ROADMAP

1. Read `docs/plans/DEPLOYMENT-ROADMAP.md`
2. Find the entry for this phase
3. Update status from 🚧 (or 📋) to ✅ Complete
4. Commit: `docs(roadmap): mark Phase N complete`

### 4. CAPTURE POSTMORTEM

Compile a brief postmortem and append it to the plan file as a `## Postmortem` section:

- **What went well** — slices that passed cleanly
- **What was tricky** — slices that required retries or amendments
- **Lessons learned** — patterns to remember for next time
- **Future work** — anything deferred or flagged during review

Commit: `docs(phase-N): add postmortem`

### 5. PUSH & PR (ask first)

**Do NOT push automatically.** Ask me:

> "Push to remote and create a PR? [Yes / Push only / Skip]"

- **Yes**: `git push origin <branch>` + offer to create PR
- **Push only**: `git push origin <branch>`
- **Skip**: Leave commits local

### 6. SUMMARY

Output:

```
Phase: <name>
Status: ✅ Complete
Commits: N
Files: N created, N modified
Roadmap: Updated
Pushed: Yes/No
```

If phase is complete: "Phase shipped ✅ — ready for the next feature."

---

### 7. CAPTURE LESSONS TO MEMORY

After shipping, persist lessons learned so future phases benefit from this experience.
This step uses Copilot's built-in memory system — no external tools required.

**Save to `/memories/repo/`** (workspace-scoped, survives across sessions):

1. **`conventions.md`** — Append any new coding patterns, naming conventions, or
   architectural decisions established during this phase. Do not overwrite existing entries.

2. **`lessons-learned.md`** — Append what went wrong and how it was fixed. Include:
   - Slices that required retries (and why)
   - Amendments triggered during execution
   - Review Gate findings and their root causes

3. **`forbidden-patterns.md`** — Append any patterns that caused regressions or
   were flagged by the Review Gate. These become "watch for" items in future phases.

If a memory file doesn't exist yet, create it with a header and the first entry.
If it already exists, append — never overwrite prior entries.

> **Why this matters**: Without memory, every phase starts from zero. With memory,
> Phase N+1 avoids Phase N's mistakes and reuses its patterns automatically. The
> hardening step (Step 2) reads these files to inform scope and slicing decisions.

## MCP Tools (if Plan Forge MCP server is running)

- **Pre-ship validation**: call `forge_analyze` with the plan file — verify consistency score meets threshold before committing
- **Final sweep**: call `forge_sweep` to confirm zero deferred-work markers remain
- **Scope check**: call `forge_diff` to verify no forbidden files were touched

> Run these before the commit step. If forge_analyze scores below 80, flag for the user before proceeding.

---

## Persistent Memory (if OpenBrain is configured)

- **Before shipping**: `search_thoughts("postmortem lessons", project: "<YOUR PROJECT NAME>", created_by: "copilot-vscode", type: "postmortem")` — load lessons from prior phase postmortems to check for recurring shipping issues (failed pushes, missed changelog entries, forgotten tags)
- **After postmortem**: `capture_thoughts([...lessons], project: "<YOUR PROJECT NAME>", created_by: "copilot-vscode", source: "phase-N-postmortem", type: "postmortem")` — batch capture all lessons, patterns, architecture decisions, bugs, and conventions from this phase
- **Include**: architecture decisions, patterns discovered, bugs encountered, conventions established, and anything flagged for future phases
