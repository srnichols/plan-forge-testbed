## The 5 Questions Before Writing ANY Code

### 1. Does this code BELONG in this file/layer?

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| **Controllers / Routes** | HTTP handling only — no business logic |
| **Services** | Business logic only — no data access |
| **Repositories / Data Access** | Database queries only — no business rules |
| **Components / Views** | UI rendering only — no side effects |

### 2. Does a PATTERN already exist for this?

- Search existing codebase for similar functionality
- Check `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` files
- Follow existing patterns — don't create new approaches

### 3. Will this SCALE appropriately?

- Consider high-volume data scenarios
- Consider concurrent users
- Consider future feature additions

### 4. Is this TESTABLE?

- Can business logic be unit tested in isolation?
- Are dependencies injectable?
- Are side effects isolated and mockable?
- **Have I written the test first?** (TDD for business logic)

### 5. HOW will this FAIL?

- What if the database is unavailable?
- What if the API returns an error?
- What if the user provides invalid input?
- Add proper error handling for ALL failure modes

## Separation of Concerns

### The 4-Layer Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  PRESENTATION               │  Components, Pages, Views
│  (render UI, handle events) │  ❌ No business logic
├─────────────────────────────┤
│  API / CONTROLLERS          │  Routes, Endpoints
│  (HTTP handling only)       │  ❌ No business logic, no SQL
├─────────────────────────────┤
│  SERVICES                   │  Business Logic
│  (validation, orchestration)│  ❌ No SQL, no HTTP
├─────────────────────────────┤
│  DATA ACCESS                │  Repositories, ORM queries
│  (database operations only) │  ❌ No business rules
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## Non-Negotiable Best Practices

### Type Safety
- **No `any`** (TypeScript) / **No `dynamic`** (C#) / **No `Any`** (Python) when type is known
- Explicit types on function signatures
- Use generics over type assertions

### Error Handling
- No empty catch blocks — always log or handle
- Use typed error classes, not generic exceptions
- Return structured error responses (RFC 7807 ProblemDetails or equivalent)

### Async Patterns
- All I/O operations must be async
- Never block on async operations (no `.Result`, `.Wait()`, `asyncio.run()` in async context)
- Support cancellation where the platform provides it

### Security
- Parameterized queries — never string interpolation in SQL
- Input validation at system boundaries
- No secrets in code — use environment variables or secret managers

### Testing
- TDD for business logic: Red → Green → Refactor
- Integration tests for data access
- E2E tests for critical user flows

## Decision Framework

```
New code needed?
  │
  ├─ Does it exist already? → YES → Reuse it
  │                          → NO ──┐
  │                                  │
  ├─ Which layer? ──► Controller (HTTP) │ Service (logic) │ Repository (data) │ Component (UI)
  │                                  │
  ├─ Does a pattern exist? → YES → Follow the pattern
  │                         → NO → Create pattern, document in instructions.md
  │
  ├─ Is it testable? → NO → Refactor until it is
  │
  └─ How will it fail? → Add error handling for each case
```

## Code Review Checklist

Before suggesting code changes, verify:

- [ ] Code is in the correct layer
- [ ] Follows existing patterns
- [ ] All types explicit (no `any`/`dynamic`/`object`)
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Input validated at boundaries
- [ ] Tests included for new features
- [ ] No sync-over-async patterns
- [ ] Security best practices followed

## Temper Guards

Common shortcuts agents take that still produce compiling code but erode architecture quality:

| Shortcut | Why It Breaks |
|----------|--------------|
| "Putting this logic in the controller is simpler" | Controllers become untestable God objects. Business logic belongs in services where it can be unit tested without HTTP plumbing. |
| "One service can handle both concerns" | Violates Single Responsibility. When requirements diverge, the combined service becomes a maintenance bottleneck with tangled dependencies. |
| "We'll refactor to the proper layer later" | Later never comes. Every shortcut trains the next agent session to copy the wrong pattern. Do it right now — it takes the same number of lines. |
| "This is a one-off, patterns don't apply" | One-offs multiply. The next developer (or agent) sees the exception and copies it. Follow the pattern even for one-offs. |
| "Adding an interface for one implementation is over-engineering" | Interfaces enable testing, future swaps, and dependency injection. The cost is one file — the benefit is permanent testability. |
| "I'll skip the repository and query directly from the service" | Services with data access can't be unit tested without a database. The repository boundary exists to make testing fast and reliable. |

### Tool-surface (ACI) temper guards

When designing or modifying any MCP tool surface (`forge_*` handlers, output payloads, schemas), watch for these shortcuts. Empirically validated against the SWE-agent ACI principle: the agent only performs as well as the surface lets it.

| Shortcut | Why It Breaks |
|----------|--------------|
| "Return the full object to be safe" | Unbounded payloads (30KB+ snapshots, 10K-event captures) blow agent context budgets and cause the agent to skip later tool calls or hallucinate to fit. **Fix**: return summary counts/status by default; offer a `drill` / `verbose` opt-in for details. |
| "Raw CLI output is good enough" | Silent success or empty stdout is ambiguous to the agent — it cannot tell "no findings" from "command failed quietly". **Fix**: post-process to inject an explicit positive message (`"No markers found. Code is complete!"`) or structured `{ ok: true, count: 0 }`. |
| "Pagination is too hard; return all" | Tools like `forge_run_plan`, `forge_diagnose`, and `forge_home_snapshot` can return arbitrarily large activity logs. **Fix**: always paginate with `limit` + `cursor` + `hasMore`; pick a small default (10–25). |
| "Empty response means nothing happened" | A bare `{ hits: [], total: 0 }` reads as failure to most agents. **Fix**: include a `message` field describing what was searched, what filters were active, and how to broaden the query. |
| "I'll add the field, agent will figure it out" | Undocumented response fields force the agent to guess. **Fix**: every new payload field must appear in the tool's `description`, `inputSchema`, and the `TOOL_METADATA.example.output`. |

**Reference standard**: `forge_search` is the gold standard ACI surface — bounded 80-char snippets, sparse fields (`{ source, recordRef, snippet, score, timestamp }`), `total` + `truncated` for pagination metadata, and a friendly `message` on the empty path. Pattern-match new tool refactors against it.

## Warning Signs

Observable patterns indicating these principles are being violated:

- A controller method contains database queries or ORM calls (bypassed service + repository layers)
- A service imports HTTP-specific types like `HttpContext`, `IActionResult`, or status codes (leaking HTTP into business logic)
- A repository contains `if/else` business rules, calculations, or validation beyond query construction (business logic in data access)
- A single file handles both routing and data persistence (collapsed layers)
- A new utility/helper class created for a one-time operation (premature abstraction — inline it)
- A class has more than 10 public methods or exceeds 300 lines (God object forming)
- A method accepts more than 5 parameters (missing a model or configuration object)
- Test files are absent for new service or repository classes (TDD skipped)
- A new MCP tool returns more than ~10KB of JSON in its happy path with no opt-in flag (unbounded ACI surface — paginate or summarize)
- A new MCP tool returns silent empty results (`{ hits: [] }` with no `message` field) when filters match nothing (ambiguous to agents)
