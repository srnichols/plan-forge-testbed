# AI Plan Hardening Runbook — Usage Instructions

> **Purpose**: Quick-reference guide for using the [AI-Plan-Hardening-Runbook.md](./AI-Plan-Hardening-Runbook.md) to harden and execute phase plans  
> **When to use**: Every time you have a new or updated `*-PLAN.md` to prepare for agent execution  
> **Version**: 2.0 (Multi-Stack)

---

## Workflow Overview

The pipeline has **7 steps** (Step 0–6) using **4 sessions**. Each session is isolated to prevent context bleed.

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SESSION 1 — Specify & Plan                                       │
│  Step 0: Specify feature (recommended — define what & why)        │
│  Step 1: Pre-flight checks (agent — automated)                    │
│  Step 2: Harden the plan + resolve TBDs (agent)                   │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  SESSION 2 — Execution                                            │
│  Step 3: Execute slices (agent, slice-by-slice)                   │
│  Step 4: Completeness sweep (same or new session)                 │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  SESSION 3 — Review & Audit                                       │
│  Step 5: Independent review + drift detection (fresh agent, R/O)  │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  SESSION 4 — Ship                                                 │
│  Step 6: Commit, update roadmap, capture postmortem, push/PR      │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> **Why separate sessions?** The executor shouldn't self-audit. Fresh context eliminates blind spots.
>
> **Step 0 in Session 1**: Step 0 (Specify) runs at the start of Session 1 instead of floating outside. If you already have clear requirements, skip Step 0 and start at Step 1.
>
> **Pipeline prompts**: Each step is also available as a prompt template in `.github/prompts/step<N>-*.prompt.md` — browse the file picker for a self-documenting workflow.

## When to Use This Pipeline

| Change Size | Examples | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **Micro** (<30 min) | Bug fix, config tweak, copy change | **Skip** — direct commit |
| **Small** (30–120 min) | Single-file feature, simple migration | **Optional** — Scope Contract + Definition of Done only |
| **Medium** (2–8 hrs) | Multi-file feature, new API endpoint | **Full pipeline** — all 5 steps |
| **Large** (1+ days) | New module, schema redesign, cross-cutting | **Full pipeline + branch-per-slice** |

---

## Step 0: Specify Feature (Optional)

Before writing a plan, use this step to define *what* you're building and *why*. This is especially valuable for teams that are new to structured planning or when requirements are unclear.

> **Prompt template**: `.github/prompts/step0-specify-feature.prompt.md`

Open a new agent session and use the Step 0 prompt template. It walks you through:

1. **Problem Statement** — What problem does this solve? Who has it?
2. **User Scenarios** — Concrete step-by-step usage examples
3. **Acceptance Criteria** — Measurable "done" criteria
4. **Edge Cases** — What could go wrong?
5. **Out of Scope** — What this feature does NOT do
6. **Open Questions** — Unknowns tagged with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`

The output is a specification block you paste into your Phase Plan as front matter.

### `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` Markers

Any uncertainty in the spec gets tagged:
```
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: describe what's unclear]
```

These markers are **blocking** — Step 2 (Harden the Plan) will refuse to proceed if any remain unresolved. This prevents ambiguity from leaking into execution.

> **Skip this step** if you already have clear, well-defined requirements.

---

## Step 1: Pre-flight Checks

Open a **new agent session** (Copilot Chat → Agent Mode).

> **Prompt template**: `.github/prompts/step1-preflight-check.prompt.md`

Replace `<YOUR-PLAN>` with your plan filename, then copy the entire block.

### Pre-flight Prompt (Copy-Paste)

```text
Act as a PRE-FLIGHT CHECK AGENT for plan hardening.

Run these checks and report results. If any check fails, report the failure and do not proceed to Step 2.

1. GIT STATE — Run `git pull origin main` and `git status`.
   Report: clean / dirty (list uncommitted files if dirty).

2. ROADMAP LINK — Read docs/plans/DEPLOYMENT-ROADMAP.md.
   Confirm the phase for <YOUR-PLAN> exists with a one-line goal.
   Report: ✅ found (quote the goal) / ❌ missing.

3. PLAN FILE — Confirm docs/plans/<YOUR-PLAN>.md exists and is non-empty.
   Report: ✅ exists (N lines) / ❌ not found.

4. CORE GUARDRAILS — Confirm these files exist and are non-empty:
   - .github/copilot-instructions.md
   - .github/instructions/architecture-principles.instructions.md
   - AGENTS.md
   Report: ✅ all present / ❌ missing (list which).

4b. AGENTIC FILES — Check if prompt templates, agent definitions, and skills exist:
   - .github/prompts/ — list *.prompt.md files found (0 is OK for non-preset repos)
   - .github/agents/ — list *.agent.md files found
   - .github/skills/ — list */SKILL.md files found
   Report: ✅ N prompts, N agents, N skills found / ⚠️ none found (optional — won't block)

5. DOMAIN GUARDRAILS — Scan <YOUR-PLAN>.md for keywords to identify relevant domains.
   For each domain detected, confirm the matching guardrail file exists:
   - UI/Component/Frontend/Razor/React/Vue → .github/instructions/frontend.instructions.md (or blazor/react specific)
   - Database/SQL/Repository/ORM/migration → .github/instructions/database.instructions.md
   - API/Route/Controller/REST → .github/instructions/api-patterns.instructions.md
   - Auth/OAuth/JWT/OIDC/session → .github/instructions/auth.instructions.md
   - GraphQL/Schema/Resolver → .github/instructions/graphql.instructions.md
   - Security/CORS/Secrets/Validation → .github/instructions/security.instructions.md
   - Docker/K8s/deploy/CI → .github/instructions/deploy.instructions.md
   - Test/spec/coverage → .github/instructions/testing.instructions.md
   Report: domains detected + guardrail status for each.

6. PROJECT PRINCIPLES — Check if docs/plans/PROJECT-PRINCIPLES.md exists.
   If exists: read it and confirm plan doesn't violate any Core Principle.
   Report: ✅ Project Principles found (N principles) / ⚠️ no Project Principles file (optional)

7. BRANCH CHECK — Does the plan declare a Branch Strategy?
   If yes: confirm current branch matches the plan's declared branch.
   If no: recommend a strategy based on estimated effort.
   Report: ✅ on correct branch / ❌ wrong branch / ⚠️ no strategy declared

Output a summary table:

| Check | Result | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Git state | ✅/❌ | ... |
| Roadmap link | ✅/❌ | ... |
| Plan file | ✅/❌ | ... |
| Core guardrails | ✅/❌ | ... |
| Agentic files | ✅/⚠️ | ... |
| Domain guardrails | ✅/❌ | ... |
| Project Principles | ✅/⚠️ | ... |
| Branch check | ✅/⚠️/❌ | ... |

If ALL pass: "Pre-flight complete ✅ — proceed to Step 2 (Harden the Plan)"
If ANY fail: "Pre-flight FAILED ❌" + list exactly what to fix.
```

---

## Step 2: Harden the Plan

Open a **new agent session**. Replace `<YOUR-PLAN>` with your plan filename.

> **Prompt template**: `.github/prompts/step2-harden-plan.prompt.md`

### Hardening Prompt (Copy-Paste)

```text
Read these files first:
1. docs/plans/AI-Plan-Hardening-Runbook.md
2. docs/plans/<YOUR-PLAN>.md
3. docs/plans/DEPLOYMENT-ROADMAP.md
4. .github/copilot-instructions.md
5. docs/plans/PROJECT-PRINCIPLES.md (if exists)

Also check for prior phase lessons (if they exist — skip if not found):
- /memories/repo/conventions.md — patterns and conventions from earlier phases
- /memories/repo/lessons-learned.md — past mistakes to avoid
- /memories/repo/forbidden-patterns.md — patterns that caused regressions

Now act as a PLAN HARDENING AGENT (see the Plan Hardening Prompt in the runbook).

Harden <YOUR-PLAN>.md by adding all 6 Mandatory Template Blocks from the runbook:
- Scope Contract (in-scope, out-of-scope, forbidden actions)
- Required Decisions (flag anything implicit as TBD)
- Execution Slices (30-120 min each, with Depends On + Context Files + Parallelism tag)
- Re-anchor Checkpoints
- Definition of Done (must include Reviewer Gate checkbox)
- Stop Conditions

For each Execution Slice:
- Tag as [parallel-safe] (with Parallel Group) or [sequential]
- Include relevant .github/instructions/*.instructions.md files in Context Files
- List only instruction files whose domain matches the slice (not all 15 — each consumes context budget)
- Add a Parallel Merge Checkpoint after each parallel group

Do NOT add features or expand scope. Only structure what already exists.

If a Specification Source is referenced in the Scope Contract, ensure each
slice includes a "Traces to" field mapping to requirements in that spec.

If Project Principles exist, validate that no execution slice violates a
Core Principle or introduces a Forbidden Pattern. Flag violations as
REQUIRED DECISIONS that must be resolved before execution.

If a Requirements Register is present, ensure each Execution Slice includes
a "Traces to" field (e.g., "Traces to: REQ-001, REQ-003"). Flag any
requirement with no corresponding slice as a gap.

After hardening, run a TBD RESOLUTION SWEEP:
1. Scan Required Decisions for TBD entries.
2. Resolve using context from the plan, roadmap, and guardrails.
3. If a TBD requires human judgment, list it and ask the user.
4. Wait for all TBDs to be resolved before finalizing.

Also validate parallelism tags:
- Are [parallel-safe] slices truly independent (no shared files)?
- Are Parallel Merge Checkpoints present after each parallel group?

After all sections are drafted, run a PLAN QUALITY SELF-CHECK before outputting:

1. Does every Execution Slice have at least one validation gate with an exact command?
2. Does every [parallel-safe] slice avoid touching files shared by other slices in the same group?
3. Are all REQUIRED DECISIONS resolved (no TBD remaining)?
4. Does the Definition of Done include "Reviewer Gate passed (zero 🔴 Critical)"?
5. Do the Stop Conditions cover: build failure, test failure, scope violation, and security breach?
6. Does every slice list only the instruction files relevant to its domain (not all 15)?
7. Are MUST acceptance criteria from the spec traceable to at least one slice's validation gate?

If any check fails, revise the plan before outputting.

Finally, run a SESSION BUDGET CHECK:
- Count total slices
- If 8+ slices: recommend a session break point (e.g., "Plan for a session break
  after Slice N — commit progress, start a new session, resume from Slice N+1")
- If any single slice has 5+ Context Files: flag it and suggest trimming to the 3 most relevant

Output a TBD summary:
| # | Decision | Status | Resolution |
|---|----------|--------|------------|

If ALL TBDs resolved: "Plan hardened ✅ — proceed to Step 3 (Execute Slices)"
If ANY need input: list them and WAIT.
```

---

## Step 3: Execute Slice-by-Slice

Open a **new agent session** (separate from hardening).

> **Prompt template**: `.github/prompts/step3-execute-slice.prompt.md`

### Execution Prompt (Copy-Paste)

```text
Read these files first:
1. docs/plans/AI-Plan-Hardening-Runbook.md (Execution Agent Prompt + Sections 10-11)
2. docs/plans/<YOUR-HARDENED-PLAN>.md
3. .github/copilot-instructions.md

Now act as an EXECUTION AGENT (see the Execution Agent Prompt in the runbook).

<investigate_before_coding>
Before writing code that depends on an existing file, read that file first. Never
assume a method signature, type name, or import path — verify it by opening the file.
If the plan references a file you haven't loaded, load it before coding against it.
</investigate_before_coding>

<implementation_discipline>
Only make changes specified in the current slice. Do not add features, refactor
existing code, add abstractions, or create helpers beyond what the slice requires.
Do not add error handling for scenarios that cannot occur within this slice's scope.
Do not add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you did not change.
The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current slice.
</implementation_discipline>

Execute the hardened plan one slice at a time, starting with Slice 1.

Before starting Slice 1, run a PRE-EXECUTION TRACEABILITY CHECK:
- Scan the spec's MUST acceptance criteria
- Verify each MUST criterion maps to at least one slice's validation gate
- If any MUST criterion has no corresponding validation gate, flag it and ask before proceeding

Before each slice, load its Context Files (including .github/instructions/*.instructions.md guardrails).
When scaffolding new entities/services/tests, use the matching prompt template from .github/prompts/.
Follow the validation loop exactly. Commit after each passed slice.
If any gate fails or any ambiguity arises, pause and ask for clarification.

Re-anchor after each slice using the lightweight check (4 yes/no questions).
Do a full re-anchor every 3rd slice or when a lightweight check flags a concern.

For [parallel-safe] slices:
- Note which Parallel Group they belong to
- After all slices in a group complete, run the Parallel Merge Checkpoint
- If any parallel slice fails, pause all slices in that group and report

After ALL slices pass, run the COMPLETENESS SWEEP (Section 6.1).
```

### If a Gate Fails

Follow the **Rollback Protocol** (Runbook Section 10):

| Strategy | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| `git stash` | Quick save — preserves work for review |
| `git checkout -- .` | Discard changes for single slice |
| Branch-per-slice | Safest — recommended for high-risk phases |

### If the Agent Hits Context Limits

1. Commit completed work
2. Open new session with same Execution Prompt
3. Run the **Session Resume Checklist** before continuing:
   - `git status` — confirm clean working tree (all prior slices committed)
   - `git log --oneline -5` — verify last committed slice number
   - Read the hardened plan's Scope Contract and Stop Conditions
   - Check for new `## Amendments` since last session (read them if present)
   - Identify the next unexecuted slice and load its Context Files
   - State: "Resuming from Slice N. Prior slices 1–(N-1) are committed."

---

## Step 4: Completeness Sweep

After all slices pass, before the Reviewer Gate.

> **Prompt template**: `.github/prompts/step4-completeness-sweep.prompt.md`

### Completeness Sweep Prompt (Copy-Paste)

```text
Read these files first:
1. docs/plans/AI-Plan-Hardening-Runbook.md (Section 6.1)
2. docs/plans/<YOUR-HARDENED-PLAN>.md (Definition of Done)
3. .github/copilot-instructions.md

Now act as a COMPLETENESS SWEEP AGENT (see Section 6.1 of the runbook).

Scan ALL files created or modified during this phase for:
- TODO, HACK, FIXME comments
- Mock/placeholder/stub data (hardcoded records, fake values)
- "will be replaced" / "Simulate" / "Seed with sample" comments
- Stub implementations (methods that return defaults / do nothing)
- Commented-out code with future intent

For each finding:
1. Wire it to the real service/API/method
2. Remove the deferred-work comment
3. Verify build + tests pass after each batch

Output:
1) Findings count (before → after)
2) Files modified
3) New methods/types added
4) Build: pass/fail
5) Tests: pass/fail

If ANY finding cannot be resolved without scope expansion: pause and report the blocker.
```

---

## Step 5: Review & Audit Gate

Open a **fresh agent session** (not the execution session).

> **Prompt template**: `.github/prompts/step5-review-gate.prompt.md`

### Review & Audit Prompt (Copy-Paste)

```text
Read these files first:
1. docs/plans/AI-Plan-Hardening-Runbook.md (Section 6.2 + Drift Detection Prompt)
2. docs/plans/<YOUR-HARDENED-PLAN>.md
3. .github/copilot-instructions.md
4. .github/instructions/ (relevant guardrail files for this phase)
5. docs/plans/DEPLOYMENT-ROADMAP.md
6. docs/plans/PROJECT-PRINCIPLES.md (if exists)

Now act as a REVIEWER GATE + DRIFT DETECTION AGENT.

You are an independent quality gate. You should be a different session from the one that wrote the code.

--- PART A: CODE REVIEW ---

Review checklist:
1. SCOPE COMPLIANCE — All changes within the Scope Contract?
2. FORBIDDEN ACTIONS — Off-limits files/folders touched?
3. ARCHITECTURE — Code follows layer separation?
4. ERROR HANDLING — Proper error types, no empty catch blocks?
5. NAMING — Follows project naming conventions?
6. PATTERNS — Follows existing patterns from .github/instructions/?
7. TESTING — New features covered by tests?
8. SECURITY — Input validation? No secrets in code?
9. PROJECT PRINCIPLES — Core Principles respected? Forbidden Patterns absent? (if Project Principles file exists)

For each finding, assign: 🔴 Critical / 🟡 Warning / 🔵 Info

Output Part A:
| # | File | Finding | Severity | Rule Violated |
|---|------|---------|----------|---------------|

--- PART B: DRIFT DETECTION ---

Compare Scope Contract against actual changes:
1. SCOPE CREEP — Work not in Scope Contract?
2. UNPLANNED FILES — Files not in any Execution Slice?
3. NON-GOAL VIOLATIONS — Work contradicting Out of Scope?
4. FORBIDDEN ACTIONS — Off-limits touched?
5. ARCHITECTURAL DRIFT — Patterns conflicting with instructions?

Output Part B:
| File | Issue | Violated Section |
|------|-------|------------------|

--- PART C: TRACEABILITY CHECK (if Specification Source exists) ---

If the plan references an external specification or Requirements Register:
1. Verify every requirement in the spec has at least one slice that addresses it
2. Verify no slice implements functionality NOT in the spec
3. Flag any spec requirements with no corresponding validation gate

Output Part C:
| Requirement | Traced to Slice(s) | Status |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|

If no specification is referenced, skip Part C entirely.

For Part C: Use the Requirements Register (if present) OR the external
Specification Source (if referenced) as the source of truth.

--- COMBINED SUMMARY ---

- Code Review: Critical: N | Warnings: N | Info: N
- Drift Detection: Drift found: Yes/No (N issues)
- Verdict: PASS or FAIL (LOCKOUT)

Do NOT modify any files. Report only.

If the verdict is PASS and the phase is Small or Medium (≤5 slices), you may proceed
to Step 6 (Ship) in this same session — Session 4 is optional for smaller features.
For Large phases (6+ slices), a separate Session 4 is recommended.
```

### If Lockout Is Triggered

1. Do not continue in the original execution session
2. Document the finding in `## Amendments`
3. Open a new agent session to re-execute affected slice(s)
4. Re-run Review & Audit Gate after the fix

### Targeted Re-Review (after LOCKOUT fix)

If re-reviewing after a LOCKOUT fix, the reviewer may focus on:
1. The re-executed slices and their changed files (primary audit)
2. Integration points between fixed and adjacent slices (regression check)
3. The specific 🔴 Critical finding(s) from the original LOCKOUT (confirm resolved)

Full review of unchanged slices may be skipped unless the fix introduced cross-cutting changes.

---

## Post-Execution Checklist

- [ ] All Definition of Done criteria satisfied
- [ ] Completeness Sweep passed (zero TODO/mock/stub artifacts)
- [ ] Review & Audit Gate passed (zero 🔴 Critical, no drift)
- [ ] Phase shipped via Step 6 (or manually committed)
- [ ] Post-Mortem captured in plan file
- [ ] Guardrail files updated with new patterns
- [ ] `DEPLOYMENT-ROADMAP.md` status updated to ✅ Complete
- [ ] Committed and pushed

---

## Step 6: Ship

Open a **new agent session** (or continue after the Review Gate if context allows).

> **Prompt template**: `.github/prompts/step6-ship.prompt.md`

This step handles the post-review housekeeping that's easy to forget:

1. **Commit** with a conventional commit message derived from the plan
2. **Update roadmap** status to ✅ Complete
3. **Capture postmortem** (what went well, what was tricky, lessons learned)
4. **Push & PR** (with your confirmation)

> **Skip this step** for micro/small changes where you handle git manually.

## Alternative: Using Pipeline Agents

Instead of copy-pasting prompts for each session, you can use the **pipeline agents** — pre-built `.agent.md` files that chain the full workflow with clickable handoff buttons.

### Pipeline Agent Chain

```
Specifier → Plan Hardener → Executor → Reviewer Gate → Shipper
     │              │              │              │            │
     │  "Start      │  "Start      │  "Run        │  "Ship     │
     │  Plan        │  Execution   │  Review      │  It →"     │  (terminal)
     │  Hardening   │  →"          │  Gate →"     │            │
     │  →"          │              │              │            │
     │              │              │         LOCKOUT:          │
     │              │              │  "Fix Issues →" ──────────┘
     │              │              │  (returns to Executor)
```

### How to Use

1. **Open a chat** with the `Specifier` agent (`.github/agents/specifier.agent.md`)
2. **Describe your feature idea** — the agent interviews you to produce a specification
3. When done, click **"Start Plan Hardening →"** to hand off to the Plan Hardener agent
4. The **Plan Hardener** runs pre-flight checks, adds the 6 mandatory template blocks, and resolves TBDs
5. When done, click **"Start Execution →"** to hand off to the Executor agent
6. The **Executor** runs slices one-by-one with validation gates, then runs the completeness sweep
7. When done, click **"Run Review Gate →"** to hand off to the Reviewer Gate agent
8. The **Reviewer Gate** audits all changes read-only and reports a PASS/FAIL verdict
9. If PASS: click **"Ship It →"** to hand off to the Shipper agent (commits, updates roadmap, captures postmortem)
10. If LOCKOUT: click **"Fix Issues →"** to return to the Executor for targeted fixes, then re-run the Review Gate

### Pipeline Agents vs Copy-Paste Prompts

| Aspect | Pipeline Agents | Copy-Paste Prompts |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Session transitions | Clickable handoff buttons | Manual copy-paste into new session |
| Context carry-over | Automatic via handoff prompt | Manual (reference plan file) |
| Customization | Edit the `.agent.md` files | Edit the prompt text |
| LOCKOUT recovery | Click "Fix Issues →" to return to Executor | Manually open new session |
| Post-review shipping | Shipper agent handles commit/roadmap/postmortem | Manual git commands |
| Functionality | Identical core pipeline | Identical core pipeline |

> **Both approaches produce the same result.** Pipeline agents just make session transitions smoother and add automated shipping. Use whichever you prefer.
