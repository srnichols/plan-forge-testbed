# Release Notes Skill

## Trigger
"Generate release notes" / "Prepare release" / "What changed since last release?"

## Steps

### 1. Identify Release Range
```bash
# Find the last tag
git describe --tags --abbrev=0

# List commits since last tag
git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline --no-merges
```

### Conditional: No Tags Found
> If no tags found → ask user for the commit range to use.

### 2. Categorize Changes
Parse commit messages using conventional commit prefixes:

| Prefix | Category | Show In Notes |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| `feat` | New Features | ✅ Always |
| `fix` | Bug Fixes | ✅ Always |
| `perf` | Performance | ✅ Always |
| `docs` | Documentation | ✅ If significant |
| `refactor` | Internal | ⚠️ Only if user-visible |
| `test` | Tests | ❌ Skip |
| `chore` | Maintenance | ❌ Skip |
| `ci` | CI/CD | ❌ Skip |

### 3. Check CHANGELOG
Read `CHANGELOG.md` for additional context:
- Are there entries not yet in the CHANGELOG?
- Does the CHANGELOG match the git history?

### 4. Generate Release Notes

Format for **GitHub Release**:
```markdown
## What's New

### Features
- **Feature name**: brief description (#PR)

### Bug Fixes
- Fix description (#PR)

### Performance
- Improvement description (#PR)

## Breaking Changes
- (list any breaking changes with migration steps)

## Contributors
- @username (N commits)
```

### 5. Verify
- [ ] All features from this release are listed
- [ ] No unreleased features included
- [ ] Breaking changes have migration instructions
- [ ] Commit references are correct

## Safety Rules
- NEVER fabricate changes not in the git log
- ALWAYS flag breaking changes prominently
- Include migration steps for any breaking change
- Ask for human review before publishing


## Temper Guards

| Shortcut | Why It Breaks |
|----------|--------------|
| "The commit messages are good enough" | Commit messages are for developers. Release notes are for users — different audience, different detail level. |
| "Nobody reads release notes" | Users, support teams, and auditors rely on release notes. Missing notes cause support tickets and compliance gaps. |
| "I'll write them after release" | Post-release notes are always incomplete. Context fades fast — write them while the work is fresh. |

## Warning Signs

- Release notes don't mention breaking changes — API or behavior changes not flagged
- Version number missing or inconsistent — notes reference wrong version or omit it
- No link to CHANGELOG — notes generated but not persisted to the project's changelog
- New features undocumented — features merged but not mentioned in notes
- Generated from wrong commit range — notes include changes from a different release cycle

## Exit Proof

After completing this skill, confirm:
- [ ] Version number present and matches the release tag
- [ ] Breaking changes explicitly documented with migration guidance
- [ ] Generated from actual git history (`git log` range verified)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with the new entry
- [ ] All merged PRs and features accounted for in the notes
## Persistent Memory (if OpenBrain is configured)

- **Before generating notes**: `search_thoughts("release", project: "<YOUR PROJECT NAME>", created_by: "copilot-vscode", type: "decision")` — load prior release decisions, breaking change precedents, and versioning conventions
- **After release notes are finalized**: `capture_thought("Release: v<version> — <key changes summary>", project: "<YOUR PROJECT NAME>", created_by: "copilot-vscode", source: "skill-release-notes")` — persist release history for future changelog continuity
