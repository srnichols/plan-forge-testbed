## The AI-Native SDLC Forge Shop

> **Plan Forge is the orchestration harness that sits *on top of* GitHub Copilot (and other AI coding tools).** It does not replace your model or your IDE — it adds the SDLC layer GitHub deliberately leaves to the ecosystem: planning, validation gates, memory, cost control, and reviewer separation.
>
> **It is also licensed MIT because your SDLC is yours, and your institutional memory lives in OpenBrain** — a user-owned service — because your accumulated decisions should not be trapped inside any one AI vendor.

> **A blacksmith doesn't hand raw iron to a customer. They smelt it, hammer it, temper it — and then they watch, because a blade that isn't maintained will dull.**
>
> Plan Forge is a **full-lifecycle AI development shop**. Raw ideas are **smelted** through the Crucible into structured plans. Plans are **forged** into working code through a 7-step hardened pipeline. Shipped code is **guarded** by LiveGuard — drift, secrets, dependencies, incidents, all watched in real time. And every finding is **learned** back into the shop's memory, so the next run starts smarter than the last.
>
> *Smelt the idea. Forge the code. Guard the build. Learn from every run.*

## The Four Stations

Plan Forge is one shop with four stations. Each one handles a distinct part of the software lifecycle — and they all share one memory.

| Station | Verb | What happens here | Start with |
|---------|------|------------------|-----------|
| 🪨 **Smelt** | *Smelt the idea* | Rough idea → Crucible interview → tempered plan with scope contract and validation gates. | [Crucible](docs/manual/crucible.html) · [Tempering design notes](docs/plans/tempering-design-notes.md) |
| 🔨 **Forge** | *Forge the code* | Hardened plan → DAG-scheduled execution → quorum consensus → shipped code. The classic 7-step pipeline. | [Your First Plan](docs/manual/your-first-plan.html) · [AI Plan Hardening Runbook](docs/plans/AI-Plan-Hardening-Runbook.md) |
| 🛡️ **Guard** | *Guard the build* | Shipped code → drift scoring, secret scan, dep watch, regression guard, incident capture, remote alerts. | [What is LiveGuard?](docs/manual/what-is-liveguard.html) · [LiveGuard Tools](docs/manual/liveguard-tools.html) |
| 🧠 **Learn** | *Learn from every run* | Findings → **Hallmark provenance**-stamped OpenBrain memory → **capability-negotiated OpenBrain writes** → Health DNA → self-tuned escalation, cost, and quorum thresholds. **Anvil** deduplicates high-frequency writes; **Lattice** indexes code structure for blast-radius scoring. | [Memory Architecture](docs/manual/memory-architecture.html) · [Bug Registry + Testbed](docs/capabilities.md) |

And the **control room** that ties them together: the [live dashboard](docs/manual/dashboard.html) at `localhost:3100/dashboard` with 25 tabs, session replay, WebSocket event hub, cost reports, OTLP traces, and a remote bridge for Telegram / Slack / Discord / OpenClaw.

## Verified Results

**Verified**: 38+ phases self-built, 3285 self-tests, 84 MCP tools, zero manual rollbacks. See [docs/capabilities.md](docs/capabilities.md).

### A/B Test Results (April 2026)

Same app, same model (Claude Opus 4.6), same time (~7 min). Only difference: Run A had Plan Forge.

| Metric | Plan Forge | Vibe Coding |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Tests** | **60** | 13 |
| **Interfaces** | **6** | 0 |
| **DTOs** | **9** | 0 |
| **Quality Score** | **99/100** | **44/100** |

## How the Stations Work Together

The four stations form a closed loop: **Smelt** intake → **Forge** builds → **Guard** watches → **Learn** captures findings into memory → next **Smelt** starts smarter. Inside the Forge, a deterministic slice executor runs the plan; a reflective inner loop — retries with reflexion context, trajectory capture, auto-skill promotion, and postmortems — turns every slice into a research step that teaches the next one. Together, the ten opt-in inner-loop subsystems compose into a self-deterministic agent loop that keeps execution reproducible while the loop's context improves each pass.

For architecture diagrams, the 7-step pipeline mermaid, the LiveGuard cycle, and the self-improving feedback loops, see **[the Shop Tour](https://planforge.software/shop-tour.html)** and the [interactive manual](https://planforge.software/manual/).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **VS Code** with **GitHub Copilot** (free, Pro, or Enterprise)
- **Git** installed

### 1. Clone and Run Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge.git my-project-plans
cd my-project-plans
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
.\setup.ps1 -Preset dotnet          # or: typescript, python, java, go, swift, rust, php, azure-iac

# Mac / Linux
./setup.sh --preset dotnet
```

Setup copies all framework files, installs MCP dependencies, and generates config. Zero manual steps.

### 2. Start Planning

1. Open VS Code → Copilot Chat → **Agent Mode**
2. Describe your feature → the pipeline guides you through 7 steps
3. LiveGuard watches automatically after you ship

### 3. (Recommended) Enable Persistent Memory

Plan Forge ships with **L1 (Hub) + L2 (`.forge/*.jsonl`) memory built in**. The **L3 layer** — cross-session, cross-tool, semantic-search memory that powers Reflexion lessons, Auto-skills, cross-project Federation, and 28 auto-capturing MCP tools — requires [**OpenBrain**](https://srnichols.github.io/OpenBrain), a self-hosted MCP server (PostgreSQL + pgvector). Plan Forge works without it (every hook degrades silently), but the inner loop only *improves over time* when L3 is present.

Pick the path that fits:

| Path | Time | Cost | Best for |
|------|------|------|----------|
| **Docker Compose** | ~5 min | Free | Local dev, single machine |
| **Supabase Cloud** | ~10 min | ~$0.10–$0.30 / mo | Solo / small team, zero ops |
| **Kubernetes / Azure Container Apps** | ~30 min | Cloud rates | Teams, federation across repos |
| **Skip for now** | 0 min | — | Try Plan Forge first; enable later with `pforge brain hint` |

Full walkthrough: **[srnichols.github.io/OpenBrain](https://srnichols.github.io/OpenBrain)**. Already running OpenBrain? `pforge brain status` confirms Plan Forge sees it.

See [docs/CLI-GUIDE.md](docs/CLI-GUIDE.md) for all presets, flags, and multi-agent options.

### 7 AI Agent Adapters

One setup command, every tool: `setup.ps1 -Agent all`

GitHub Copilot (primary) · Claude Code · Cursor · Codex CLI · Gemini CLI · Windsurf · Generic

### MCP Server (88 Tools)

`pforge-mcp/server.mjs` exposes core, LiveGuard, Watcher, Crucible, Tempering, Bug Registry, Testbed, Forge-Master, Hallmark, Anvil, Lattice, Sync, and Memory operations. Live dashboard at `localhost:3100/dashboard`. 103+ REST endpoints for external integrations.

Key tools: `forge_run_plan` · `forge_liveguard_run` · `forge_analyze` · `forge_master_ask` · `forge_capabilities` · `forge_smith` · `forge_cost_report` · `forge_lattice_query` · `forge_sync_memories` · `forge_memory_capture`

### Optional Capabilities

| Feature | How to Enable | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Quorum mode** | Automatic (complexity ≥ 6) | 3 models analyze in parallel, reviewer synthesizes. Works **OAuth-only via the Copilot CLI** &mdash; no API keys required. Add `XAI_API_KEY` to mix in a Grok leg. Self-tuning threshold. |
| **Audit Loop** | `pforge audit-loop` or `.forge.json#audit` | Closed-loop drain: content-audit scanner → triage → fix. Default off; opt-in via `audit.mode: "auto"` or `"always"`. |
| **Auto-escalation** | Built-in | Model fails → auto-promotes. Chain reorders by success rate. |
| **Cost tracking** | Built-in | Per-slice tokens, 23-model pricing, `--estimate` with historical calibration. |
| **OpenBrain memory** (L3) | **Recommended** — see [Quick Start § 3](#3-recommended-enable-persistent-memory) | The L3 memory layer. 28 tools auto-capture findings with **Hallmark provenance** stamps via **capability-negotiated OpenBrain writes**. **Anvil** deduplicates Δ-identical writes. 4 prompts search before acting. Without it, Reflexion, Auto-skills, and Federation are inert. |
| **Extensions** | `pforge ext add <name>` | HIPAA, SaaS multi-tenancy, etc. |
| **CI validation** | `srnichols/plan-forge-validate@v1` | GitHub Action for plan quality gates. |
| **Notifications** | Configure in `.forge.json` | Slack, Discord, Telegram, webhooks via bridge. |
| **Spec Kit bridge** | Auto-detected | Import specs + constitution from Spec Kit projects. |
