# Plan Forge Manual — Ebook Completion Audit (Round 2)

> **Premise**: Re-read the manual not as an Apress acquisitions editor (that was [Round 1](manual-apress-publisher-review.md))
> but as a **reader buying a $40 ebook** on AI-Native SDLC. The Apress review focused on *scaffolding*
> (numbered figures, recap boxes, prereqs, PDF export). This round focuses on *content gaps* —
> chapters and references that an ebook reader expects to find but that the manual doesn't yet provide.
>
> **Status**: Discussion document. Drives the execution plan at
> [`docs/plans/Phase-MANUAL-EBOOK-COMPLETION-PLAN.md`](../plans/Phase-MANUAL-EBOOK-COMPLETION-PLAN.md).
> **Scope reviewed**: Full TOC of `docs/manual/` (29 chapters across 5 Parts + 17 appendices),
> the blog inventory under `docs/blog/`, and the source surfaces (`pforge-mcp/EVENTS.md`,
> `docs/REST-API.md`, `pforge-mcp/capabilities.mjs`, `pforge.ps1`, `extensions/catalog.json`).
> **Date**: 2026-05-18.

## TL;DR — Reader's One-Page Verdict

> "It's already most of an ebook. The reference scaffolding is excellent — 90 MCP tools, 97 CLI
> commands, glossary, alphabetical book index, list of figures, unified API surface index. What's
> missing is the **content** that turns a reference manual into an ebook you'd actually *read*:
> the origin story, the case-study vignettes, a 'how do I…?' index, and a small handful of
> reference pages that everyone reaches for and currently can't find (`.forge.json` schema,
> environment variables, REST API, event payloads, cost economics, security threat model)."

If we only do **three things** from this list, do these:

1. **Above-the-fold positioning fix** — one sentence on `index.html`, `README.md`, and `what-is-plan-forge.html` that says explicitly: *Plan Forge is the orchestration harness on top of GitHub Copilot (and other AI coding tools); it does not replace your model or your IDE.* The full "harness on substrate" story already exists in Appendix H but is invisible to a first-contact reader — early-reader feedback shows that even GitHub-ecosystem-fluent readers default-assume Plan Forge is a Copilot alternative. This is the cheapest, highest-impact slice in the entire phase.
2. **Foreword** absorbing the existing blog posts into ebook voice ("From Impossible to Seven Minutes") **and** explicitly volunteering the positioning disclaimer in a paragraph titled *"What this book is **not**"*. The book has no origin story; the blog does.
3. **Cost & Economics chapter** — Plan Forge's biggest commercial question is *"how much will this cost me?"* and the manual doesn't answer it directly. The data is in the dashboard's Cost tab and in `forge_cost_report`; the narrative is missing. Lead with the **four levers** documented in §2 below (quality-at-constant-time, quality-per-extra-dollar, rework-avoidance, memory-as-subsidy) and the **compounding flywheel** observation — the cost curve bends downward over the life of a project, which is the opposite of what most engineering managers default-assume.

The full execution plan ([`Phase-MANUAL-EBOOK-COMPLETION-PLAN.md`](../plans/Phase-MANUAL-EBOOK-COMPLETION-PLAN.md))
breaks the gap-closure into **18 independently shippable content slices + 1 QA closer = 19 slices total** across 4 clusters
(Story · Reference · Domain · Closure).

## 1 · What changed since the Apress review (Round 1)

The earlier review identified ~13 recommendations, ranked by impact/effort. Many of those have since
landed — worth listing what's done so this round doesn't re-recommend solved problems.

| Apress recommendation (Round 1) | Status today |
|---|---|
| 2.1 Numbered Figures and Listings | ✅ Done — Appendix P (List of Figures) exists; figures use `id="fig-N-M"` |
| 2.5 "Conventions used in this book" front-matter page | ✅ Done — `conventions.html` exists with edition history |
| Status / "What's new" badges | ✅ Done — `STATUS` registry in `manual.js` drives sidebar pills |
| Quickstart / "Hello World" | ✅ Done — Q1/Q2/Q3 quickstart cluster |
| Glossary + auto-generated A-Z index | ✅ Done — `glossary.html`, `book-index.html` |
| Audience / Persona ladders | ❌ Still missing — addressed by **Slice A2** below |
| Single-source export (PDF / single HTML) | ❌ Still missing — deferred (not in this phase; tooling concern) |
| Errata page | ❌ Still missing — deferred (lightweight; could fold into Project History) |
| End-of-Part wrap-ups | 🟡 Partial — some Parts have intros, no closers |
| "Try it yourself" exercises per chapter | ❌ Still missing — deferred (sample-project carries the load for now) |
| Sidebars (long-form named callouts) | 🟡 Partial — `lessons-learned.html` collects what could be embedded sidebars |
| Pull quotes / epigraphs | ❌ Deferred — stylistic, not a content gap |

**Verdict**: Round 1's scaffolding recommendations largely landed. What remains from Round 1
(audience ladders, single-source PDF, errata) is a mix of "addressed in Round 2's plan" (ladders =
Slice A2) and "deferred to a future tooling phase" (PDF export, errata page).

## 2 · Round 2 — Three tiers of remaining gap

### Tier 1A — Reference completeness (7 missing pages)

Pages that a reader **will go looking for** and currently can't find a canonical home for.

| # | Missing reference | Why a reader reaches for it | Suggested home |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **`.forge.json` schema reference** | Config has ~20 top-level keys (`hooks.*`, `meta.*`, `quorum.*`, `costEstimator.*`, `liveguard.*`, `openclaw.*`, `cli.*`…). Customization Ch 9 covers *philosophy*, not the schema. | New **Appendix T** |
| 2 | **Environment variables reference** | `PFORGE_*`, `XAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `PFORGE_QUORUM_TURN`, `PFORGE_API_TOKEN` are mentioned in 5+ chapters with no single index | New **Appendix U** |
| 3 | **Lifecycle Hooks reference** | PreDeploy / PreCommit / PreAgentHandoff / PostSlice + `plan-forge.json` config are mentioned in 5 chapters; no one page documents them | New section in **Customization Ch 9** |
| 4 | **Event / WebSocket hub catalog** | Ch 11 says "60+ event types"; `pforge-mcp/EVENTS.md` has the data; no manual appendix documents payload shapes per event | New **Appendix V** (promote `EVENTS.md`) |
| 5 | **REST API reference** | `docs/REST-API.md` exists at repo root, not in the manual. App Q indexes REST but doesn't document it | New **Appendix W** (promote `REST-API.md`) |
| 6 | **Skills reference** | 11 skills per preset, only mentioned in passing in Customization | Section inside **Instructions & Agents Reference** |
| 7 | **Errors & exit codes** | `forge_*` tools return structured errors; CLI has exit codes; today the only way to learn them is to fail | Section in **Troubleshooting Ch 15** + new **Appendix X** with the flat table |

### Tier 1B — Domain chapters (4 missing chapters)

Chapters whose absence is **conspicuous given Plan Forge's stated audience** (enterprise + solo dev).

| # | Missing chapter | Why it's missing matters | Suggested home |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Security & Threat Model** | The book moves credentials, source code, and plan files through LLMs. App N (Compliance & Data Residency) covers regulatory framing; no chapter covers the *security posture* — what leaves your machine, prompt-injection mitigations, the extensions-catalog supply chain story | New chapter in **Part III (Guard)** |
| 2 | **Cost & Economics** | Cost is referenced across 4 chapters and the Cost dashboard tab; no chapter teaches *budgeting a plan*: cost-per-slice in practice, when quorum is worth it, when `--quorum=speed` beats `--quorum=power`, how to set spend caps. **Bigger than the token-spend question**: the chapter has to make the **effort-savings / time-to-done / quality** case that lets a team lead or engineering manager justify adopting Plan Forge to their own boss. Today that argument lives in the blog; the manual asks the reader to assemble it themselves. | New chapter in **Part II (Forge)** |
| 3 | **Plan Pattern Library** | The manual teaches HOW to write a plan; readers want a *Design Patterns*-style catalog of plan archetypes (DB migration, refactor, multi-service rollout, spike+retire, bug-sweep) with skeleton templates | New **Appendix Y** |
| 4 | **Failure-Mode Catalog** | Troubleshooting Ch 15 is symptom-driven; a parallel catalog organized by Plan Forge *subsystem* (gate, quorum, watcher, OpenBrain, snapshot, model-pool, hub) keyed to "symptom → cause → fix" triples would be the single most-bookmarked page | New **Appendix Z** |

#### Why the Cost & Economics chapter is the highest-leverage one in Cluster C

The other Cluster C chapters answer reader questions a developer would ask in private. Cost &
Economics has to answer the question a **team lead emails their VP of Engineering** to get budget
approval. That's a different writing job, and it's the one the manual is most underprepared for
today.

The chapter should not lead with API pricing tables. It should lead with **the three numbers
that already exist in our own blog posts** and that nobody on the maintainer team has yet pulled
into a single page:

| Lever | Concrete evidence already in the repo | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Quality at constant time** | Same model, same ~7-minute budget: **99/100 quality vs 44/100**. 4.6× more tests. The vibe-coded run "needed a rewrite of the architecture" to reach production. | [`docs/blog/ab-test-plan-forge-vs-vibe-coding.html`](../blog/ab-test-plan-forge-vs-vibe-coding.html) |
| **Quality per extra dollar** | Quorum mode: **+$0.22 per feature** ($0.62 → $0.84, +35%) buys 20% more tests, DRY helpers, and modern patterns. "The cheapest code review you'll ever buy." | [`docs/blog/quorum-mode-3-models.html`](../blog/quorum-mode-3-models.html) |
| **Rework avoidance** | The vibe run's extra minute was spent fighting 12 compilation errors and backtracking. Plan Forge's guardrails removed the rework loop, not added overhead. | [`docs/blog/ab-test-plan-forge-vs-vibe-coding.html`](../blog/ab-test-plan-forge-vs-vibe-coding.html) ("Guardrails don't slow you down. Rework slows you down.") |
| **Memory as a tier-downgrade subsidy** | After the v3.x memory upgrades (Hallmark + Anvil + Lattice + `forge_sync_memories`): **cost per slice ~$0.09 → $0.04 (−55%)**, **Sonnet-4.6 success rate ~78% → 91% (332/365 slices)**, **drift score −64% over 90 days**, **Opus-escalation rate dropped to ~0%** for memory-aware plans. The Phase-MEMORY-QA receipt: **7 slices for $0.07 total on Sonnet alone, zero failed slices**. | [`docs/manual/memory-system.html`](../manual/memory-system.html#cheaper-models) ("The memory upgrades subsidize the model choice.") |

Three reader personas this chapter has to serve, in this order:

1. **The team lead pitching their boss.** Needs a "Total Cost of a Feature" worksheet:
   *(plan-time tokens) + (build-time tokens) + (quorum overhead, if any) − (avoided rework hours
   × loaded engineer rate) − (avoided defects shipped to prod)*. The blog has the numerator; the
   manual has to teach the denominator.
2. **The engineering manager doing the rollout.** Needs a "When to spend more" decision tree —
   `--quorum=speed` for refactors, `--quorum=power` for security-sensitive or financial logic,
   no quorum for boilerplate. Plus spend caps (per-plan, per-day, per-month) and how to alert
   when a runaway slice burns through budget.
3. **The IC operator running a plan.** Needs the existing material: `forge_cost_report`, the
   Cost dashboard tab, per-model pricing, how `forge_estimate_quorum` projects spend *before*
   the run starts so the picker shows real dollar amounts.

**Token-efficiency angle** (often missed in cost discussions): Plan Forge's planning pass front-loads
context so the build pass spends fewer tokens re-discovering architecture. The 4-session model
deliberately starts each session with a fresh context window, which sounds wasteful but is
*cheaper* than letting a single conversation degrade into hallucination-driven rework. The chapter
should make this concrete with a token-count comparison from a real run (the `forge_cost_report`
output for one of our own phases would serve).

**The memory-system multiplier** (the most under-told part of the story today): a fresh session is
only cheaper than a degraded one *if* the new session starts smarter than the last one ended. That's
the job of the v3.x memory stack — **Hallmark** (provenance stamps that let the agent trust prior
records without re-deriving them), **Anvil** (the L3 boundary with a dead-letter queue so bad
captures don't poison context), **Lattice** (the code graph that turns "who calls this function?"
from a 50-second grep into a 50-millisecond query), and **`forge_sync_memories`** (knowledge
crosses session boundaries automatically). The cumulative effect, documented in
[`memory-system.html`](../manual/memory-system.html#cheaper-models), is that the cheaper model
(Sonnet-4.6) now succeeds on 91% of slices where it used to manage ~78%, while cost per slice
fell from ~$0.09 to $0.04 (−55%) and Opus-escalation rate effectively went to zero on
memory-aware plans. The chapter needs to **lift this story out of the memory chapter and put it in
the cost chapter where the budget conversation actually happens** — a team lead reading Part II
should not have to discover this benefit accidentally in Part IV.

The Cost & Economics chapter should also be explicit about the **compounding flywheel**: every
finished feature deposits decisions and lessons into OpenBrain. The next feature on the same
project starts with that context already loaded, which makes it both cheaper *and* higher-quality
than the previous feature. The cost curve bends downward over the life of a project, which is
exactly the opposite of what most engineering managers assume happens with AI tooling. That single
observation, backed by the −55% and −64% numbers above, is probably the most persuasive paragraph
the chapter will contain.

**What this chapter must NOT do**: become a price list. Per-token rates change quarterly; the
chapter must teach the *mental model* (cost per feature, cost per quality unit, cost of rework
avoided) so it stays useful when GPT-5-mini drops in price or when a new model joins the pool.

### Tier 2 — Story / ebook UX (5 missing pieces)

The manual reads as a **reference**, not an **ebook**. These slices supply the narrative arc that
turns it into something a reader works through cover-to-cover.

The user's blog (`docs/blog/*.html`) is the goldmine — most of the source material already exists
in marketing voice and needs absorbing into reference voice.

| # | Missing piece | Source material already exists in | Suggested home |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Foreword — "From Impossible to Seven Minutes"** | `the-journey-from-impossible-to-seven-minutes.html` + `the-80-20-wall.html` + `guardrails-lessons-learned.html` | New **Front Matter** chapter |
| 2 | **Reader-Journey Ladders ("Pick your path")** | The four personas: solo dev / team lead / reviewer / enterprise architect / extension author | New **Front Matter** chapter |
| 3 | **"A Day in the Forge" vignettes** | `the-loop-that-never-ends.html` + `ab-test-plan-forge-vs-vibe-coding.html` + `quorum-mode-3-models.html` | New **Appendix R** with 3 case studies |
| 4 | **Task-based "How do I…?" index** | All existing chapters — this is a navigational layer over them | New **Appendix S** |
| 5 | **"What's new in this Edition" banner** | `project-history.html#v3-6-openbrain-l3`, `conventions.html#edition-history` | Edit to **`index.html`** only |
| 6 | **Above-the-fold positioning: "harness on substrate, not a Copilot replacement"** | [`github-stack-alignment.html`](../manual/github-stack-alignment.html) (Appendix H — the content is excellent but buried in the appendices) + [`plan-forge-on-the-github-stack.html`](../manual/plan-forge-on-the-github-stack.html) (Appendix I) | Promoted into **Foreword (A1)**, **What is Plan Forge? (existing chapter)**, **`index.html` hero**, and **README.md tagline** |
| 7 | **Stakeholder Briefing (the "white paper inside the ebook")** | The reusable ~50% of the per-prospect briefings the maintainer is already writing (an example enterprise-prospect briefing prepared 2026-05-18, sections 1/4/6/8/9/11/AppA — held privately, not in this repo) | New Front Matter page **`docs/manual/stakeholder-briefing.html`** sitting between the Foreword (A1) and the Reader-Journey Ladders (A2) |

#### The hidden positioning gap (the "Microsoft-coworker test")

This is the single most surprising finding of the audit, and it didn't surface from re-reading the
manual — it surfaced from **early-reader feedback that even readers fluent in the GitHub/Copilot
ecosystem assumed Plan Forge was an alternative to Copilot rather than a layer on top of it.** If
that assumption forms at the homepage or in the first chapter, the rest of the manual is read
through the wrong frame and everything else (cost, security, plan workflow) gets misinterpreted.

The positioning *is* documented — Appendix H ([`github-stack-alignment.html`](../manual/github-stack-alignment.html))
is excellent. It introduces the "harness on substrate" metaphor, names the lane GitHub explicitly
leaves to the ecosystem, and ships an SVG of the full stack. Appendix I
([`plan-forge-on-the-github-stack.html`](../manual/plan-forge-on-the-github-stack.html)) is the
surface-by-surface technical companion. Together they're a complete answer.

The problem is **placement**. A new reader's path is roughly:

1. `index.html` (homepage) → mentions "Copilot" 20+ times, never says "Plan Forge does not
   replace Copilot"
2. `README.md` → same: lists Copilot as a prerequisite, never explicitly disclaims replacement
3. `what-is-plan-forge.html` → has the disclaimer ("Not an AI model. Plan Forge works with
   whatever AI you already use") at **line 231**, three screens below the fold
4. Appendix H → has the full answer, but it's **Appendix H**, and no reader reaches an appendix
   on first contact

Result: the positioning is correct but invisible to the audience most at risk of misreading it
(GitHub-ecosystem-fluent readers who already know Copilot does codegen and assume any other
"AI coding tool" must be competing).

**What the chapter / surface changes should do** (each is small and additive — not a rewrite):

1. **One-sentence positioning line at the top of three surfaces.** Same sentence, repeated
   verbatim, on `index.html` hero, `README.md` opening, and the first paragraph of
   `what-is-plan-forge.html`. Suggested wording:
   > *Plan Forge is the orchestration harness that sits **on top of** GitHub Copilot (and other AI
   > coding tools). It does not replace your model or your IDE — it adds the SDLC layer GitHub
   > deliberately leaves to the ecosystem: planning, validation gates, memory, cost control, and
   > reviewer separation.*
2. **Foreword (Slice A1) must explicitly say it.** The Foreword is where a confused reader's
   assumption gets locked in — it has to volunteer the disclaimer, not wait for the reader to ask.
   A single paragraph titled "What this book is **not**" early in the Foreword does this best.
3. **Promote the Appendix H SVG forward.** The "harness on substrate" diagram is the single
   most clarifying artifact in the entire manual. It belongs above-the-fold on `index.html` and as
   Figure 1 of the Foreword, not behind a sidebar click into Appendix H. Appendix H stays as the
   long-form reference; the diagram graduates to front-matter status.
4. **Add a "Plan Forge is / Plan Forge is not" table** to `what-is-plan-forge.html` immediately
   after the opening paragraph. Two columns, ~5 rows each. Mirrors the framing of Round 1's
   "Conventions used in this book" page — same editorial pattern, applied to identity instead of
   typography. This is the page that absorbs the line-231 disclaimer and gives it the prominence
   it should have had.

**Why this matters for the plan.** Item #6 should not be a standalone slice; it should be
**baked into Slices A1 (Foreword) and A2 (Reader-Journey Ladders) plus a small standalone edit
to `index.html` / `README.md` / `what-is-plan-forge.html`**. The execution plan
([`Phase-MANUAL-EBOOK-COMPLETION-PLAN.md`](../plans/Phase-MANUAL-EBOOK-COMPLETION-PLAN.md))
should grow a small new slice — call it **A6 — Above-the-fold positioning** — between A5 and
Cluster B. Cost: roughly one focused commit. Impact: prevents the wrong frame from forming in
the first thirty seconds of contact with the book.

#### The "Stakeholder Briefing" — a white paper inside the ebook

Closely related to the positioning gap but distinct: today, when a stakeholder, prospect, or
internal champion needs a sharable explanation of Plan Forge, the maintainer ends up authoring a
bespoke per-prospect briefing (an example was prepared on 2026-05-18 for an enterprise prospect;
that artifact is held privately and is not in this repository). Inspecting that artifact's TOC
in the abstract tells us exactly which content is being re-derived every time:

| Per-prospect briefing section | Canonical / reusable? | Belongs in… |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Executive Summary (problem → solution → result) | ✅ Reusable | The new briefing |
| 2. Reading alongside the customer's own slides | ❌ Prospect-specific | Stays per-prospect |
| 3. Where the customer said it hurts | ❌ Prospect-specific | Stays per-prospect |
| 4. Plan Forge on top of the GitHub Copilot ecosystem | ✅ Reusable (= Appendix H, condensed) | The new briefing |
| 5. Mapping Plan Forge to customer's squads | ❌ Prospect-specific | Stays per-prospect |
| 6. The memory layer the customer's plan doesn't have | ✅ Reusable (= memory-system chapter, condensed) | The new briefing |
| 7. Mapping Plan Forge to customer's KPIs | ❌ Prospect-specific | Stays per-prospect |
| 8. Things Plan Forge adds you didn't ask for | ✅ Reusable (cross-sell list) | The new briefing |
| 9. Adoption path — two routes | ✅ Reusable (generic routes) | The new briefing |
| 10. Concrete 30-day pilot proposal | ❌ Prospect-specific (timeline + names) | Stays per-prospect |
| 11. Why open source matters | ✅ Reusable | The new briefing |
| 12. The ask | ❌ Prospect-specific | Stays per-prospect |
| Appendix A — Visual reference | ✅ Reusable (= existing stack SVGs) | The new briefing |

That's a **clean ~50/50 split**: half is canonical content the manual already owns in long form,
half is genuinely per-prospect framing that can't and shouldn't be pre-written. The bespoke
briefings aren't wasteful because they're customized; they're wasteful because **the canonical
half is re-derived every time**. A pre-written canonical briefing turns the next per-prospect doc
from a from-scratch task into a remix.

**Format proposal** — a single page, **`docs/manual/stakeholder-briefing.html`**, that:

- Sits in **Front Matter**, after the Foreword (A1) and before the Reader-Journey Ladders (A2).
- Reads end-to-end in **10–15 minutes** — the longest a busy VP gives you.
- Is **skimmable** — bold lead sentence per section, bullet-first, ruthless about cutting nuance
  the chapters cover.
- Has a clean **shareable URL** (`https://planforge.software/manual/stakeholder-briefing.html`)
  so it can drop into an email or a chat tool as one link.
- Is **self-contained** — does not require the reader to navigate into other chapters; cross-links
  exist for the reader who wants to drill in, but the briefing stands alone.
- Pulls numbers from the **same source** as the cost chapter (C2) so the briefing and the book
  can never drift on the headline figures (−55% / −64% / 99 vs 44 / +$0.22 quorum overhead).

**Content skeleton** (≤ 8 sections, mirroring the reusable half of the per-prospect briefing TOC):

1. **Executive Summary** — one paragraph: the 80/20 wall, the four-loop fix, the receipt
   ($0.07 for the Phase-MEMORY-QA plan on Sonnet alone).
2. **What Plan Forge is — and is not** — the harness-on-substrate sentence from Slice A6,
   plus the "is / is not" table.
3. **The four cost levers** — the table already drafted for Cluster C / Cost & Economics.
4. **The compounding flywheel** — the paragraph already drafted for the cost chapter.
5. **What we add that you might not have asked for** — open-source memory layer, reviewer
   separation, validation gates, plan provenance, fleet ops, audit trail.
6. **Adoption path** — two generic routes: (a) adopt as-is from the community, (b) fork and
   brand for your organization. Both end at the same Level-3 destination.
7. **Why open source matters here** — IP, audit, customization, no vendor lock.
8. **Make this yours — the tailoring flow** — the briefing's closing section is a three-option
   ladder telling any reader how to tailor the briefing for their own organization, without
   needing to contact the maintainer. See “The public tailoring flow” below for the deliverable
   shape. This section is the rhetorical close: the briefing about Plan Forge ends by inviting
   the reader to use Plan Forge to remix the briefing. That's the demo.

**What this is *not***:

- Not a *second book inside the book*. If it grows past ~3000 words, refactor — move detail back
  into the chapters and cross-link.
- Not a replacement for the per-prospect briefings. Those still get written. They just start
  from ~50% pre-written content.
- Not a marketing landing page. Those live at `index.html`. The Stakeholder Briefing is for the
  reader who has *already decided to evaluate seriously* and needs to walk a colleague or their
  boss through the decision.

**Risk and mitigation.** The headline risk is **drift between the briefing and the book** — the
briefing claims a number, the book updates the number, the briefing forgets to update. Three
mitigations: (a) all headline numbers are sourced from the same `manual.js` count tokens (already
proven safe in the drift-sweep commit `d2494c8`); (b) every section ends with a "Read more →"
link into the canonical chapter, so a reader noticing a discrepancy can self-correct; (c) the
briefing carries a STATUS pill with the version stamp, identical to other chapters, so a stale
briefing is visually obvious.

**Slice in the plan.** This is **Slice A7 — Stakeholder Briefing** in
[`Phase-MANUAL-EBOOK-COMPLETION-PLAN.md`](../plans/Phase-MANUAL-EBOOK-COMPLETION-PLAN.md).
Depends on A6 (positioning sentence locked) and the cost-levers table from Cluster C
(reusable). Lower-priority than A6 (which fixes the upstream "wrong-frame" problem), but the
single most leveraged slice for the maintainer who is actively pitching prospects.
#### The public tailoring flow (Section 8 of the briefing, expanded)

The original draft of this section ended the briefing with *“Need a version tailored to your
organization's squads, KPIs, and pilot timeline? Open an issue or contact …”* That's wrong
shape for Plan Forge. The tool's identity is open-source-first, no funnels, no gates. Asking
the reader to *open an issue and wait* to tailor a briefing is exactly the friction Plan Forge
claims to eliminate everywhere else in the manual. The closing has to **practice what the
briefing preaches**.

Replace the “contact us” footer with a **three-option self-service ladder**, in increasing
order of Plan Forge involvement:

| Path | Effort | Tool surface | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Template path** | ~5 minutes | Copy [`docs/manual/stakeholder-briefing-template.md`](../manual/stakeholder-briefing-template.md), fill five placeholders (`<<COMPANY>>`, `<<SQUADS>>`, `<<KPIS>>`, `<<PILOT_TIMELINE>>`, `<<THE_ASK>>`), publish wherever your org publishes briefings | The internal champion who already knows the answers and just needs a structured doc |
| **2. Skill path** | ~15 minutes | Run `pforge skill stakeholder-briefing` (CLI) or invoke `/stakeholder-briefing` in your AI coding tool. The skill prompts for the five placeholders, optionally crawls your existing strategy docs / org chart / OKR dashboard for context, and emits a tailored briefing as markdown or HTML | The internal champion who wants Plan Forge to draft the prospect-specific 50% from their existing materials |
| **3. Community path** | days, async | Open a discussion in the Plan Forge repo with your draft. A maintainer or community reviewer will critique structure, sharpen claims, flag overreach | The champion who has a draft and wants a second pair of eyes before sending it to their VP |

Three deliverables ship as part of Slice A7, in this order:

1. **`docs/manual/stakeholder-briefing.html`** — the canonical 8-section briefing itself.
2. **`docs/manual/stakeholder-briefing-template.md`** — the same 8 sections with the
   prospect-specific halves replaced by `<<PLACEHOLDER>>` tokens and inline guidance comments
   (e.g. `<!-- 2–4 sentences: where does this customer say the existing AI-SDLC tooling falls
   short? Lift from their own slides if possible. -->`). Shipped as `.md` (not `.html`) so
   `Copy → Paste → Edit` is one shell command.
3. **`.github/skills/stakeholder-briefing.skill.md`** — a slash-command skill following the
   existing Plan Forge skill pattern (sibling of `/database-migration`, `/release-notes`, etc.).
   The skill prompts for the five placeholders, optionally takes a `--source-dir` pointing at
   the prospect's existing strategy materials, and runs `forge_search` against them to pull
   relevant context into the “reading alongside” and “where it hurts” sections that the
   template leaves blank. Output is the filled template, written to a path the user chooses.

**Why all three, and not just the template.** The template alone covers path 1. Path 2 (the
skill) is the demo — it shows a reader who has never run Plan Forge what running Plan Forge
feels like, on a task they care about right now (writing a briefing for their boss). Path 3
(community) catches the long tail of “my draft is weird, can someone look?” without the
first-class flow depending on a human responding. The three together turn the briefing's
closing section from a marketing CTA into a working tool.

**Naming.** The skill should be `/stakeholder-briefing`, not `/sales-briefing` or
`/exec-briefing`. The audience is the internal champion arguing for adoption to their
stakeholders, not a salesperson. Wrong noun in the skill name will train wrong expectations
about when to run it.

**Risk.** This expands A7 from one HTML page to three artifacts — measurably more scope than
the other A-cluster slices. Two ways to manage it: (a) **ship all three under A7** (preferred,
because the skill is the demo and the demo is the whole point), or (b) **split into A7
(briefing + template) and A7.1 (skill)** so A7 ships with the template-as-CTA and the skill
follows in a fast-follower commit. The audit recommends (a); the open question below asks the
maintainer to confirm.

#### The two-axis anti-lock-in story

Closely tied to both the positioning gap and the Stakeholder Briefing, but distinct from each:
Plan Forge's most differentiated commercial argument is the **anti-lock-in** one, and right now
it lives mostly in the `LICENSE` file and the OpenBrain technical docs — places a first-contact
reader never reaches in the first thirty seconds. The argument is strong enough, and currently
undertold enough, that it deserves its own narrative thread woven through several slices.

**Two distinct axes of lock-in that Plan Forge inverts.** They are orthogonal; missing either
weakens the argument:

1. **SDLC process lock-in.** Most “AI for SDLC” tools ship a fixed workflow — their planning,
   their gates, their reviewers, their definition of “done”. Adopt the tool, adopt their
   opinion of how software should be built. Plan Forge is MIT-licensed *because no two shops'
   SDLC is the same*. Fork it, tweak it, delete what doesn't apply, add what does. The license
   is the existence proof: **this is your process, not the vendor's.**
2. **Institutional memory lock-in — the novel one.** Every commercial AI-coding primitive
   (Cursor, Claude Projects, Copilot's “knowledge”, future tools) captures your team's
   conversations, decisions, and patterns inside *their* cloud. The accumulated memory of how
   your team builds software ends up distributed across N proprietary silos. Switch primitives
   tomorrow and you lose the memory each one held. Plan Forge inverts this: **L3 memory lives
   in OpenBrain — a user-owned service the user runs.** Every primitive (Copilot, Claude,
   Cursor, Codex, future tools) reads from and writes to OpenBrain through the MCP surface.
   The memory never lives in the primitive, so switching primitives doesn't cost you the
   memory. The brain follows you.

**These two axes are orthogonal to the “harness on substrate” point** (§2 Tier 2 / item 6):

- *Harness on substrate* says: **we don't compete with your AI model.**
- *Anti-lock-in* says: **we don't compete with your AI model — and we don't trap your process
  or your memory inside any one model either.**

The first is a technical-orientation argument (“what kind of tool is this?”). The second is a
data-sovereignty / strategic-assets argument (“what happens to my company's accumulated
knowledge?”). Both belong above the fold, but they answer different questions a reader is
asking. A one-line summary worth quoting: *Plan Forge keeps your two most strategic assets out
of the vendor's hands — your SDLC process (MIT-licensed harness) and your institutional
memory (user-owned L3).*

**Why this matters for the manual.** Today the anti-lock-in story is **implicit**:

- `LICENSE` says MIT — but no first-contact reader opens `LICENSE` in their first thirty seconds
- [`openbrain-memory.html`](../manual/openbrain-memory.html) and [`memory-system.html`](../manual/memory-system.html)
  explain L3 ownership — but the framing is *technical* (“self-hosted L3 store”), not
  *commercial* (“your institutional memory stays yours when you switch primitives”)
- The Stakeholder Briefing's Section 7 (“Why open source matters here”) is the obvious home
  for this, but its current draft skeleton (§2 Tier 2 / item 7 above) only names “IP, audit,
  customization, no vendor lock” as bullet points without spelling out the two-axis argument

**Where to surface it** (additive, no new slice required — each item is a few sentences
woven into an existing slice):

| Surface | What to add |
|---|---|
| **A1 Foreword** (“What this book is **not**” paragraph) | *“It is also not a process you rent from us — Plan Forge is MIT-licensed because no two shops' SDLC is the same, and your institutional memory lives in OpenBrain, a service you run, not in any vendor's cloud.”* |
| **A6 Above-the-fold positioning** | Add a **second** positioning sentence after the substrate sentence: *“It is also licensed MIT because your SDLC is yours, and your institutional memory lives in OpenBrain — a user-owned service — because your accumulated decisions should not be trapped inside any one AI vendor.”* A6 now ships a **two-sentence positioning block** on each of `index.html` / `README.md` / `what-is-plan-forge.html`. |
| **A7 Stakeholder Briefing §5** (“What we add you didn't ask for”) | New bullet: *“User-owned institutional memory (OpenBrain) — portable across Claude / Copilot / Cursor / Codex / future primitives. The memory never lives in the primitive, so switching primitives doesn't cost you the memory.”* |
| **A7 Stakeholder Briefing §7** (“Why open source matters here”) | Re-scope from a thin bullet list to a **two-axis explainer**: (1) MIT process ownership — your SDLC is yours; (2) self-hosted memory ownership — your accumulated decisions are yours. This is the briefing's punchiest section once expanded — “we won't be locked in” is consistently in the top three concerns a VP raises in evaluation. |
| **C1 Security & Threat Model** | Already touches data residency via App N. Should explicitly include the memory-lives-on-your-infrastructure point as a **security** benefit, not just a sovereignty benefit — your team's conversations and decisions never leave your trust boundary. |
| **C2 Cost & Economics** | One paragraph: switching primitives is normal (token prices change, new models drop, your favourite model gets deprecated). Switching primitives *without losing memory* changes the cost calculus. **Lock-in tax avoidance is itself a cost lever** — a fifth lever alongside the four already in the cost chapter. |

**Cross-ref map update.** §4a already lists forward + backward cross-refs for A1 / A6 / A7 /
C1 / C2. Each of those slices now owes an additional anti-lock-in callout per the surface map
above. The QA closer (§4b check #3) will grep for the callout phrases inside each slice's
output file; missing the anti-lock-in callout in any of these five slices is a QA fail.

**Why no new slice.** The anti-lock-in story is a *narrative thread that runs through several
slices*, not a standalone chapter. A dedicated “Why Plan Forge is anti-lock-in” chapter would
read more like vendor-pitch than book — and would let the *other* chapters off the hook for
surfacing the argument where readers actually encounter the trade-off. Better to weave it
through five places a reader actually passes through than concentrate it in one place they
may skip.

## 3 · Tier 3 — Structural rebalancing (deferred)

Not blocking, not in the execution plan; recorded here so it isn't forgotten:

- **Part II is overloaded** (16 chapters vs 4–5 in Parts III/IV/V). The four Loop deep-dives (Self-Deterministic, Inner, Competitive, Audit) read like a mini-part "The Four Loops". The three Dashboard sub-pages want to be a Dashboard mini-part. Restructuring would be a separate phase.
- **17 appendices warrant a Part-front landing** ("Reference Material"). Currently a flat list.
- **`MEDIA` status pill** for chapters with companion videos / screencasts (when recorded). Slots into the existing STATUS registry.
- **Per-chapter "What you'll learn / Prerequisites / Next chapter" footer consistency pass** — most chapters have *some* version; a normalization pass would help.
- **Cross-reference glossary**: map Plan Forge terms to Claude Code / Cursor / Aider / OpenHands equivalents. Niche but powerful for migrating users.

---

## 4 · Why this round picks the slices it picks

The execution plan ([`Phase-MANUAL-EBOOK-COMPLETION-PLAN.md`](../plans/Phase-MANUAL-EBOOK-COMPLETION-PLAN.md))
orders work as **Cluster A (Story) → B (Reference) → C (Domain chapters)** even though the gap
analysis above is presented in the opposite order. The reasoning:

1. **Cluster A has the lowest risk + highest reader payoff.** Source material exists in `docs/blog/`;
   the slice is absorption into reference voice. No new research required.
2. **Cluster B unblocks Cluster C.** The Cost & Economics chapter (C2) wants to cite the
   `.forge.json` reference (B1) for `costEstimator.*`. The Security chapter (C1) wants to cite the
   env-vars reference (B2) and the event catalog (B4).
3. **Cluster C is the most editorial-writing-heavy.** Best done after the reference clusters are
   in place so they can be cross-linked instead of inlined.

Each slice is **one commit**. The manual's `maintain.mjs` validator is the gate (must report
`All checks passed — manual is in sync` twice consecutively).

---

## 4a · Editorial convention: forward + backward cross-references on every slice

A reader-grade ebook reads like an interconnected work, not a stack of standalone chapters. A
good textbook chapter says *“we'll cover this in detail in Chapter 6”* when it touches a topic
developed elsewhere, and a later chapter says *“as introduced in the Foreword”* when it picks
up that thread. The Plan Forge manual mostly fails this test today — chapters are well-written
but self-contained, and a reader pulling at one thread doesn't always discover the next chapter
where it continues.

**The hard rule for every slice in this phase**: a slice is not done when the new file builds
and `maintain.mjs` is green. It is done when **both** of the following are true:

1. **The new chapter contains forward cross-refs** to every other chapter or appendix that
   develops a topic the new chapter introduces. Format: a one-sentence note inline, with the
   destination as a markdown link, ideally to a named anchor. Example phrasing:
   > *“The four-lever cost argument is summarised here; §§3–4 of the
   > [Cost & Economics chapter](cost-economics.html#four-levers) develop it in full.”*
2. **At least one earlier chapter or appendix gains a backward cross-ref** pointing to the new
   chapter, so a reader who already passed through the earlier chapter can find the new one.
   This is the step slice-by-slice execution most often skips. The slice's commit message must
   explicitly list the backward-edit files.

The cross-ref map below names the expected forward and backward edits for each slice in flight.
It is not exhaustive (a slice may discover more during drafting) but it is the **minimum**.

| Slice | Must forward-link to… | Must backward-link from… |
|---|---|---|
| **A1 — Foreword** | A2 ladders · A7 Stakeholder Briefing · What-is-PF · C2 Cost & Economics · [`memory-system.html`](../manual/memory-system.html) · App H stack alignment | `index.html` (add “Start with the Foreword” above the fold) · `conventions.html` edition-history (Foreword shipped this edition) |
| **A2 — Reader-Journey Ladders** | Per-persona deep-dive chapters that each ladder rung lands on | A1 Foreword (final paragraph: “next, pick your ladder”) · `index.html` reader-paths card |
| **A3 — Vignettes (App R)** | The blog post each vignette is absorbed from (preserve attribution) · C2 Cost & Economics (vignette #2 = quorum economics) | A1 Foreword (“see Appendix R for three worked examples”) · `quickstart.html` (“then read Appendix R for context”) |
| **A4 — How-Do-I index (App S)** | Every chapter App S routes a task into | `index.html` nav · `troubleshooting.html` (“if you're trying to **do** X, see App S”) |
| **A5 — What's-new banner** | `project-history.html#v3-6-openbrain-l3` · `conventions.html#edition-history` | (no backward refs — it's a homepage banner, not a chapter) |
| **A6 — Above-the-fold positioning** | App H stack alignment · App I surface-by-surface · What-is-PF “is / is not” table | `README.md`, `index.html`, `what-is-plan-forge.html` (those *are* the surfaces being edited; A6's commit must touch all three to count) |
| **A7 — Stakeholder Briefing** | A1 Foreword · What-is-PF · App H · C2 Cost & Economics · [`memory-system.html`](../manual/memory-system.html) · the `/stakeholder-briefing` skill doc (“Tailor with the skill”) | A1 Foreword (“if you only have ten minutes, read the Stakeholder Briefing”) · `index.html` Front Matter grid · A2 Reader-Journey Ladders (“Team-lead ladder → Stakeholder Briefing first”) |
| **B1–B7 — Reference appendices** | The chapter that first introduces the topic (e.g. B1 `.forge.json` → Customization Ch 9) | The chapter that first introduces the topic (the *first introduction* gains a “full schema in App T” link); plus `unified-api-surface.html` index |
| **C1 — Security & Threat Model** | App N Compliance & Data Residency · B2 env-vars (secrets) · B4 event catalog (audit stream) · `extensions/catalog.json` story | App N (forward link “threat-model side in Ch 20a”) · `liveguard-runbooks.html` |
| **C2 — Cost & Economics** | A3 vignette #2 · B1 `.forge.json#costEstimator` · [`memory-system.html#cheaper-models`](../manual/memory-system.html#cheaper-models) · `quorum-mode-*` blog posts | Every chapter that mentions cost today (8+ chapters) gains a “see C2 for the full economics” footnote |
| **C3 — Plan Pattern Library (App Y)** | The chapter that teaches plan authoring | The plan-authoring chapter · `quickstart.html` (“start from a pattern in App Y”) |
| **C4 — Failure-Mode Catalog (App Z)** | B7 Errors & Exit Codes · `troubleshooting.html` (each symptom row links to its subsystem in App Z) | `troubleshooting.html` (App Z is the subsystem-organised companion) |

**How to enforce.** Three lightweight checks, in order of cost:

1. **Slice commit message must enumerate backward-edit files.** A slice commit that lists only
   the new chapter and not the older chapters it edited is presumptively incomplete — reject
   or amend before push.
2. **`maintain.mjs` should grow a link-validity check** (Tier 3 follow-up, not blocking this
   phase). Today it validates count tokens and registry consistency; extend it to assert every
   `../manual/*.html#anchor` reference resolves. Cheap to add, catches link rot from
   chapter-anchor renames during future edits.
3. **A periodic “cross-ref audit” slice** (e.g. quarterly) re-reads the manual end-to-end
   looking for orphaned chapters (no inbound links) and dead-end chapters (no outbound links).
   Not in this phase — records as a future maintenance ritual under §3 Tier 3.

**Why this matters disproportionately for A7.** The Stakeholder Briefing is designed to be read
first and to drive the reader into the deeper chapters. Every section of the briefing ends
with a “Read more →” link — those links *are* the briefing's value proposition. A Stakeholder
Briefing that doesn't cross-reference is a self-contained marketing page, which is the failure
mode the design is trying to avoid.

## 4b · Phase closure: the QA sweep slice

Making cross-references and diagram coverage hard requirements only helps if **someone checks at
the end that all of them actually shipped**. Slice-by-slice execution naturally tunnel-visions on
the one chapter being written; a missed backward cross-ref or a forgotten registry entry is
invisible until a reader stumbles into the gap weeks later. The phase therefore ships with a
**final closer slice — Slice QA — whose sole job is to audit the manual against this audit doc.**

**What the QA sweep checks** (every item is a `grep` or a `node maintain.mjs` invocation — no
subjective judgement):

| # | Check | Pass criterion |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Every shipped slice's file exists** at the path the slice table names | `Test-Path` on each path returns `True` |
| 2 | **Every shipped slice's `manual.js` registry entries are present** | `CHAPTERS` + ≥3 `SEARCH_SECTIONS` + `STATUS` entry for each new file |
| 3 | **Every required forward cross-ref from §4a is present** in the new chapter | `grep` for the destination anchor inside the new file |
| 4 | **Every required backward cross-ref from §4a is present** in the named earlier files | `grep` for the new chapter's URL inside each earlier file the map names |
| 5 | **Every required diagram from §4c is referenced** (re-used existing SVG or new SVG present) | `grep` for the SVG filename inside the new file; `Test-Path` on new SVG files |
| 6 | **Every internal `../manual/*.html#anchor` link resolves** | Walk all anchors across `docs/manual/*.html`; assert each link target's anchor exists |
| 7 | **`node maintain.mjs` is GREEN twice consecutively** across the full set of changes | Both runs end with `All checks passed — manual is in sync` |
| 8 | **`EDITION` constant in `manual.js` has bumped** if ≥10 content slices shipped | String compare against the previous edition value |

**What the QA sweep deliberately does NOT do**:

- **Does not auto-fix anything.** A missing backward cross-ref is named in the sweep report and
  becomes a follow-up commit by the slice's original author. Auto-fix would mask the discipline
  failure and train the next phase's executor to skip the same step.
- **Does not re-write any chapter.** Editorial revisions are out of scope. The sweep verifies
  the *structure* the plan promised, not the *quality* of the prose.
- **Does not block on deferred items.** Open question #6 (skill in A7 vs A7.1) and Tier 3
  deferrals (PDF export, errata page) are recorded as deferred, not as failures.

**Where the sweep report lives**: appended to **this audit doc as a new §7 “What actually
shipped”**, not as a separate file. Single source of truth; the historical record of the phase
lives where the phase was planned. The sweep report is a checklist of pass/fail per check
above, plus a short narrative of any deferred or follow-up items.

**Order in the slice plan**: Slice QA runs **last**. It depends on every content slice having
shipped (or being explicitly deferred with a recorded reason). Captured as Cluster D — Phase
Closure in [`Phase-MANUAL-EBOOK-COMPLETION-PLAN.md`](../plans/Phase-MANUAL-EBOOK-COMPLETION-PLAN.md).

## 4c · Diagram requirements per slice

The manual's diagram convention is **hand-authored SVG** in [`docs/manual/assets/diagrams/`](../manual/assets/diagrams/)
(37 SVGs already exist). Raster image generation is out of scope for the manual — the visual
language is consistent across the existing assets, and a generated raster would break it. The
`forge_generate_image` tool is reserved for marketing / blog assets, not manual chapters.

**Most of the new slices re-use existing SVGs.** The table below names the minimum diagram
coverage each slice owes. “Re-use” means the slice's HTML embeds an existing SVG; “New” means
the slice authors a new SVG file as part of its commit.

| Slice | Re-use existing SVG(s) | New SVG required | Why no existing match |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A1 Foreword** | [`github-stack-architecture.svg`](../manual/assets/diagrams/github-stack-architecture.svg) (as Figure 1) | — | The harness-on-substrate SVG is the right Figure 1; promoting it forward is the whole positioning fix |
| **A2 Reader-Journey Ladders** | — | `reader-journey-ladders.svg` *(optional but recommended)* | No existing diagram visualises 5-persona paths through the manual. Could fall back to a table if cost-of-authoring is too high |
| **A3 Vignettes (App R)** | [`evidence-ab-test-bars.svg`](../manual/assets/diagrams/evidence-ab-test-bars.svg) inside vignette #2 (the A/B-test case) | — | Narrative case studies; prose carries the load |
| **A4 How-Do-I (App S)** | — | — | Pure task table; no diagram |
| **A5 What's-new banner** | — | — | Text element only |
| **A6 Above-the-fold positioning** | [`github-stack-architecture.svg`](../manual/assets/diagrams/github-stack-architecture.svg) (embedded above the fold) | — | The whole point of A6 is to surface this existing SVG earlier in the reader's path |
| **A7 Stakeholder Briefing §2** (What it is / is not) | [`github-stack-architecture.svg`](../manual/assets/diagrams/github-stack-architecture.svg) | — | One canonical asset across A1 / A6 / A7 = zero drift risk |
| **A7 §3** (Four cost levers) | (deferred to C2's new SVG; reuse there) | — | C2 owns the diagram; A7 cites it |
| **A7 §4** (Compounding flywheel) | (deferred to C2's new SVG; reuse there) | — | Same |
| **B1–B7 Reference appendices** | — | — | Tables + code blocks only |
| **C1 Security & Threat Model** | [`escalation-chain.svg`](../manual/assets/diagrams/escalation-chain.svg) for the escalation context section | **`threat-model-trust-boundaries.svg`** — required | A threat-model chapter must visualise trust boundaries (workspace ↔ MCP host ↔ LLM ↔ extension catalog ↔ memory ↔ Git remote). No existing SVG covers this |
| **C2 Cost & Economics** | [`evidence-ab-test-bars.svg`](../manual/assets/diagrams/evidence-ab-test-bars.svg) (quality-at-constant-time lever), [`memory-three-tier-capture.svg`](../manual/assets/diagrams/memory-three-tier-capture.svg) (memory-as-subsidy section) | **`cost-four-levers.svg`** + **`cost-compounding-flywheel.svg`** — both required | (1) The four-levers stacked total-cost-of-feature picture is the manager-pitch artifact and has no existing match. (2) `openbrain-cross-agent-compounding.svg` covers **cross-agent memory compounding**, not the cost-per-feature curve bending downward over project lifetime — distinct concept, needs its own SVG |
| **C3 Plan Pattern Library (App Y)** | — | — (per-pattern diagrams would balloon scope; reconsider after drafting if chapter feels diagram-thin) | 15–30 archetypes; a per-pattern diagram per row is over-scope |
| **C4 Failure-Mode Catalog (App Z)** | [`troubleshooting-tree.svg`](../manual/assets/diagrams/troubleshooting-tree.svg) as lead-in | — | Pure symptom → cause → fix table; lead-in diagram is enough |

**New SVG totals**: **3 required** (`threat-model-trust-boundaries.svg`, `cost-four-levers.svg`,
`cost-compounding-flywheel.svg`) + **1 optional** (`reader-journey-ladders.svg`). Each new SVG is
part of its slice's commit, not a separate slice.

**Authoring notes for the new SVGs**:

- Match the existing style: dark `#0f172a` background, `Inter` sans-serif text, accent colours
  pulled from the Plan Forge palette (amber `#f59e0b`, blue `#60a5fa`, purple `#a78bfa`,
  emerald `#34d399`)
- Always include `<title>` and `<desc>` elements with stable `id`s for the
  `aria-labelledby` reference (the existing SVGs all do this)
- Aim for a viewBox in the 800–1000 wide × 400–500 tall range so the SVG fits the chapter
  content column without horizontal scroll on the typical reader's viewport
- The QA sweep (§4b check #5) will assert the SVG filename is referenced in the chapter HTML;
  a slice that authors a new SVG but doesn't embed it fails QA

---

## 5 · Open questions for the maintainer

These weren't resolved in the audit chat and want a thumbs-up before slice execution starts:

1. **Should the Foreword be signed?** Apress forewords usually are. The blog posts are first-person;
   the manual's voice is third-person. Three options:
   - (a) Third-person throughout, with no signature (consistent with the rest of the manual)
   - (b) Third-person body + a final signed paragraph ("— Scott Nichols, May 2026")
   - (c) First-person throughout, framed as "a letter from the author" (book-like, breaks the
     manual's voice convention once and then resumes)
2. **Vignette anonymity** — `docs/blog/ab-test-plan-forge-vs-vibe-coding.html` names a specific
   project. Do we keep the name in the vignette, or rename to "Project X" / "Tracker" to match the
   sample-project framing?
3. **"What's new" banner persistence** — should the banner disappear after the user dismisses it
   (per-edition `localStorage` key), or stay until the next edition ships?
4. **Edition bump trigger** — at what slice count do we bump the manual to **Fifth Edition (v3.x)**?
   The plan suggests ≥10 of 18 content slices; some maintainers prefer “ship the edition when the foreword
   lands" because the foreword is the most ebook-visible change.
5. **Positioning sentence(s) — sign off on the exact wording.** The audit now proposes a
   **two-sentence block** (§2 Tier 2 / item 6 + the anti-lock-in subsection):
   > *“Plan Forge is the orchestration harness that sits **on top of** GitHub Copilot (and
   > other AI coding tools). It does not replace your model or your IDE — it adds the SDLC
   > layer GitHub deliberately leaves to the ecosystem: planning, validation gates, memory,
   > cost control, and reviewer separation.”*
   >
   > *“It is also licensed MIT because your SDLC is yours, and your institutional memory lives
   > in OpenBrain — a user-owned service — because your accumulated decisions should not be
   > trapped inside any one AI vendor.”*

   Three places will repeat this block verbatim (`index.html` hero, `README.md` opening,
   `what-is-plan-forge.html` first paragraph). Cheaper to argue the wording once, before it ships
   to three surfaces, than to drift them apart later. Sub-questions: do we name competitors ("…and
   other AI coding tools like Cursor, Claude, Codex") explicitly, or stay generic? Do we lead with
   "harness on substrate" (the metaphor that already exists in Appendix H) or with the plainer
   "sits on top of" framing used above? See also OQ #7 below for the one-vs-two-sentence trade-off.6. **Slice A7 scope — ship the skill with the briefing, or split into A7 / A7.1?** The audit
   recommends shipping all three artifacts (briefing + template + `/stakeholder-briefing` skill)
   under A7 because the skill is the demo and the demo is the whole rhetorical point of the
   self-service tailoring flow. The alternative is A7 = briefing + template (with template as
   the CTA) and A7.1 = skill as a fast-follower. Confirms the scope before A7 work starts.
7. **Two-sentence positioning block — ship both sentences above the fold, or split?** The
   anti-lock-in subsection in §2 Tier 2 proposes a second positioning sentence covering MIT
   licensing + user-owned memory. Two options: (a) ship both sentences as a single
   two-sentence positioning block on `index.html` / `README.md` / `what-is-plan-forge.html`
   (audit recommendation — each sentence answers a different reader question, both belong
   above the fold); (b) keep only the substrate sentence above the fold, fold the lock-in
   sentence into a smaller follow-on note one screen below. The risk in (b) is the same risk
   that drove A6 in the first place: positioning material below the fold doesn't form the
   reader's frame.
