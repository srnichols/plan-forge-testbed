## CLI-Only Families

Anvil and Hallmark expose CLI commands (and SDK exports) instead of MCP tools — they are local-file utilities that don't benefit from MCP overhead. Capability metadata for them lives in `pforge-mcp/capabilities.mjs` so the agent can still discover and reason about them.

| Command | Purpose | Backing Module |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| `pforge hallmark show [<id>]` | **v2.95+** — Read a `hallmark/v1` provenance record (schema version, tool name, captured timestamp, content hash). Omit id to list all. | `pforge-sdk/hallmark` |
| `pforge hallmark verify <id>` | **v2.95+** — Drift detection — compare stored Hallmark provenance against current file hash; flags modifications since capture. | `pforge-sdk/hallmark` |
| `pforge anvil stat` | **v2.95+** — Anvil memoization cache stats (entries, total bytes, per-tool breakdown). | `pforge-mcp/anvil.mjs` |
| `pforge anvil clear [--tool <name>] [--olderThanMs <n>]` | **v2.95+** — Delete cache entries with at least one filter. | `pforge-mcp/anvil.mjs` |
| `pforge anvil rebuild --since <git-sha>` | **v2.95+** — Selective invalidation of cache entries whose source files changed since the given SHA. | `pforge-mcp/anvil.mjs` |
| `pforge anvil dlq list\|drain` | **v2.95+** — List or re-drive Anvil dead-letter queue records. | `pforge-mcp/anvil.mjs` |
| `pforge sync-memories` | **v2.99+** — CLI alias for `forge_sync_memories` MCP tool. | `pforge-mcp/sync-memories.mjs` |
| `pforge sync-instructions` | **v2.99+** — CLI alias for `forge_sync_instructions` MCP tool. | `pforge-mcp/sync-instructions.mjs` |
| `pforge lattice <subcommand>` | **v2.95+** — CLI mirror of the 5 `forge_lattice_*` MCP tools. | `pforge-mcp/lattice.mjs` |

## Execution Modes

| Mode | Flag | Worker | Description |
|------|------|--------|-------------|
| **Full Auto** | *(default)* | `gh copilot` CLI | Agent executes each slice with full project context |
| **Assisted** | `--assisted` | Human in VS Code | Orchestrator prompts, human codes, gates validate |
| **Cloud Agent** | *(via `copilot-setup-steps.yml`)* | Copilot cloud agent | Cloud agent provisions environment, guardrails auto-load, MCP tools available |
| **Quorum** | `--quorum` | 3 models + reviewer | All slices: 3 dry-run analyses → synthesis → execute |
| **Quorum Auto** | `--quorum=auto` | 3 models (selective) | Only high-complexity slices (score ≥ threshold) get quorum |
| **Estimate** | `--estimate` | None | Returns cost prediction without executing |
| **Dry Run** | `--dry-run` | None | Parses and validates plan structure |
| **Resume** | `--resume-from N` | Same as auto | Skips completed slices |

## Inner Loop (v2.57.0, extended in v2.58.0)

Ten opt-in subsystems that turn deterministic slice execution into a closed research loop. All default to *off*, *suggest*, or *advisory* — nothing in existing workflows breaks. See `docs/manual/inner-loop.html` and `docs/manual/competitive-loop.html` for the full state-flow diagrams.

| Subsystem | Level | Default | Config Key | Storage |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|---------|
| **Reflexion retry context** | L7 | always on | *(none)* | in-memory |
| **Trajectories** | L8 | always on | *(none)* | `.forge/trajectories/<slice>/*.md` |
| **Auto-skill library** | L2 | always on | *(none, Phase-26 toggles)* | `.forge/auto-skills/*.md` |
| **Adaptive gate synthesis** | L6 | suggest | `runtime.gateSynthesis.mode` | stdout only (never mutates plans) |
| **Plan postmortems** | L5 | always on | *(retention=10)* | `.forge/plans/<basename>/postmortem-*.json` |
| **Cross-project federation** | L4-lite | off | `brain.federation.enabled` | read-only, absolute local paths only |
| **Reviewer-agent in-loop** | L4 | off, advisory | `runtime.reviewer.enabled` | verdict attached to gate-check response |
| **Competitive execution** (v2.58) | L9 | off | `innerLoop.competitive.enabled` | worktrees under `.forge/worktrees/`; losers cleaned up |
| **Auto-fix proposals** (v2.58) | L6 | advisory | `innerLoop.autoFix.applyWithoutReview` | `.forge/proposed-fixes/*.patch` |
| **Cost-anomaly detection** (v2.58) | L5 | advisory | `innerLoop.costAnomaly.ratio` | `.forge/cost-anomalies.jsonl` |

Discover at runtime via `forge_capabilities` → `innerLoop`. Configure via Dashboard → Config tab, Dashboard → Inner Loop tab (v2.58+), or `.forge.json`.

## Self-Deterministic Agent Loop

The ten inner-loop subsystems above compose into what we call a **self-deterministic agent loop**. The slice executor stays deterministic — same plan, same config, same outcome — while the Phase-25 reflective layer (L1–L8) and Phase-26 competitive layer (C1–C3) let the loop observe itself and feed what it learns back into the next slice, the next plan's hardener, or a sibling project. Every feedback arrow is opt-in or advisory; the execution contract never mutates silently. Canonical narrative with two Mermaid diagrams: [`docs/manual/self-deterministic-loop.html`](manual/self-deterministic-loop.html).

## Agent-Per-Slice Routing

Assign a different AI model to each execution role via `modelRouting` in `.forge.json`. The orchestrator selects the appropriate model automatically based on the current operation:

| Role | Key | Default | Typical Use |
|------|-----|---------|-------------|
| General / fallback | `default` | `claude-opus-4.6` | Spec, harden, review |
| Slice execution | `execute` | `gpt-5.2-codex` | Writing code, generating tests |
| Review & audit | `review` | `claude-sonnet-4.6` | Gate checks, drift detection |

Config (`.forge.json`):
```json
{
  "modelRouting": {
    "default": "claude-opus-4.6",
    "execute": "gpt-5.2-codex",
    "review": "claude-sonnet-4.6"
  }
}
```

Override at runtime: `pforge run-plan <plan> --model gpt-5.2-codex` (applies to all roles for that run).
API providers (xAI Grok, etc.) are auto-routed by model name pattern — no extra config required.

## Auto-Escalation

When a slice fails repeatedly, the orchestrator automatically re-routes to the next model in `escalationChain` rather than retrying on the same model.

Config (`.forge.json`):
```json
{
  "escalationChain": ["auto", "claude-sonnet-4.6", "claude-opus-4.6"]
}
```

- Attempt 0: uses the configured/default model
- Attempt 1+: walks the chain in order (`"auto"` defers to `modelRouting.execute`)
- Emits `slice-escalated` event with `sliceId`, `reason`, and `models`
- Set `maxRetries` to control how many attempts are made before a slice is marked failed

## Model Performance Tracking

Per-slice performance data is appended to `.forge/model-performance.json` after every run. The orchestrator reads this file on startup and auto-selects the cheapest model with >80% historical success rate for each slice type.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `model` | Model name used for the slice |
| `sliceGoal` | Slice goal text (used for slice-type matching) |
| `passed` | `true` if the validation gate passed |
| `durationMs` | Slice execution time in milliseconds |
| `cost` | Estimated token cost for the slice |

- `--estimate` output shows the recommended model per slice with historical success rate
- Dashboard **Cost tab** shows a **Model Performance** table: run count, pass rate (color-coded), average duration, cost per run, total tokens
- `forge_cost_report` MCP tool includes `forge_model_stats` (aggregated per-model stats)

## API Providers

Plan Forge supports OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoints via the `API_PROVIDERS` registry. Models are auto-routed by name pattern.

| Provider | Models | Env Var | Endpoint |
|----------|--------|---------|----------|
| **GitHub Copilot** *(recommended)* | `gpt-4o-mini` *(default)*, `gpt-4o`, `claude-sonnet-4`, `claude-opus-4` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` (or `gh auth login`) | `models.github.ai/inference` |
| **xAI Grok** | `grok-4.20`, `grok-4`, `grok-3`, `grok-3-mini`, `grok-4.1-fast-*` | `XAI_API_KEY` | `api.x.ai/v1` |

Set the env var, use any matching model name in `--models` or `.forge.json`, and the orchestrator routes automatically.

### API Key Fallback (`.forge/secrets.json`)

Lookup order: environment variable → `.forge/secrets.json` → null.

Store API keys in the gitignored `.forge/` directory as an alternative to environment variables:

```json
{
  "XAI_API_KEY": "xai-...",
  "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..."
}
```

`.forge/` is in `.gitignore` by default — secrets are never committed.

## GitHub Copilot Integration

Plan Forge has first-class integration with GitHub Copilot, GitHub Models, and GitHub Actions for cloud-based execution and security-driven plan generation.

`forge_github_status` — Check GitHub API connectivity, Copilot subscription status, and GitHub Models API availability. Returns auth state, rate limits, and per-service health.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `githubAuth` | Authentication state (`authenticated` / `unauthenticated`) |
| `copilotPlan` | Copilot subscription plan (`individual` / `business` / `enterprise` / `none`) |
| `modelsApiAvailable` | `true` when `models.github.ai/inference` is reachable |
| `rateLimitRemaining` | Remaining GitHub API requests for the hour |

CLI: `pforge github-status`

### GitHub Models

GitHub Models (`models.github.ai/inference`) is the recommended API provider for Plan Forge. It is the default inference endpoint when `GITHUB_TOKEN` (or `gh auth login`) is configured. Supported models: `gpt-4o-mini` *(default)*, `gpt-4o`, `claude-sonnet-4`, `claude-opus-4`.

### Copilot Coding Agent Worker

Dispatch slice execution to the Copilot coding agent instead of the local CLI:

```
pforge run-plan <plan> --worker copilot-coding-agent
```

The `--worker copilot-coding-agent` flag routes each slice to a Copilot cloud agent session. Requires `copilot-setup-steps.yml` in `.github/` and an active Copilot for Business or Enterprise subscription. Guardrails and MCP tools are available inside the cloud agent environment; the dashboard receives live slice events via WebSocket.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--worker copilot-coding-agent` | Route slice execution to Copilot coding agent |
| `--worker local` | Run locally (default) |

### plan-from-sarif

Generate a remediation plan from a GitHub Code Scanning SARIF report:

```
pforge plan-from-sarif <sarif-file> [--severity high,critical] [--output docs/plans/]
```

Reads SARIF findings, groups by CWE / rule ID, and emits a hardened Plan Forge plan where each slice targets a specific vulnerability class. Integrates with `forge_secret_scan` and `forge_bug_register` — high-severity findings are auto-registered as bugs. Gate: `pforge run-plan docs/plans/<sarif-plan>.md`.

### github-metrics

Pull GitHub repository metrics (PR velocity, code frequency, contributor cadence) into the LiveGuard health context:

```
pforge github-metrics [--repo <owner/repo>] [--window 30d]
```

Metrics are written to `.forge/github-metrics.json` and surfaced on the Dashboard **GitHub** tab. `forge_health_trend` incorporates PR cycle time as a signal when the file is present. Requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `repo` scope.

| **Traces** | OTLP waterfall timeline, span detail, severity filter |

### LiveGuard Dashboard Section

A second LIVEGUARD section appears in the tab bar after a visual divider. LIVEGUARD tabs use amber — visually distinct from FORGE tabs.

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **🛡️ Health** | Overall health score, drift trend, MTTBF chart |
| **Incidents** | Open incident list, MTTR tracking, **fix-proposals feed** (v2.29) |
| **Triage** | Ranked cross-signal alert list with severity badges |
| **Security** | Secret scan results, env diff gap summary |
| **Env** | Environment variable key comparison across `.env.*` files |

Standalone (no MCP client needed): `node pforge-mcp/server.mjs --dashboard-only`

## LiveGuard MCP Tools (14 shipped v2.27–v2.30, extended through v2.53)

> Post-coding intelligence — watches gates after the forge ships. All 14 LiveGuard tools (plus 2 Watcher tools) are included in the 36-tool count above. Available as MCP tools and REST endpoints.

| `forge_quorum_analyze` | Assembles structured LiveGuard quorum prompt for multi-model analysis — no LLM calls in server | v2.29 |
| `forge_liveguard_run` | Composite health check — runs all LiveGuard tools in one call, returns unified green/yellow/red status | v2.30 |

## Lifecycle Hooks (v2.29.0)

Three hooks configured in `.forge.json` `hooks.*` block. Specs in `.github/hooks/*.md`.

| Hook | Trigger | Behavior | Blocking? |
|------|---------|----------|-----------|
| **PreDeploy** | File write to `deploy/**`, `Dockerfile*`, `*.tf`; CLI command `docker push`, `git push`, `azd up` | Runs `forge_secret_scan`; blocks on findings (hard stop). Runs `forge_env_diff`; warns on missing keys. | Hard block on secrets; advisory on env gaps |
| **PostSlice** | `git commit` with conventional commit message (`feat\|fix\|refactor\|...`) | Reads drift history; injects amber advisory (delta >5) or red warning (delta >10 or score <70) | Never blocks |
| **PreAgentHandoff** | SessionStart with dirty branch, active plan, or `--resume-from` flag | Injects LiveGuard context header; runs regression guard on dirty files; POSTs snapshot to OpenClaw (fire-and-forget, 5s timeout). Skipped when `PFORGE_QUORUM_TURN` env var is set. | Never blocks |
| **PreCommit chain** | `git commit` during `pforge run-plan` | Runs all entries listed in `hooks.preCommit.chain[]` in order. The built-in chain starts with `master-branch-reject` and `diff-classify`; any chain member can exit non-zero to abort the commit. | Yes (any chain member can block) |

Config (`.forge.json`):
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "preDeploy":       { "enabled": true, "blockOnSecrets": true, "warnOnEnvGaps": true, "scanSince": "HEAD~1" },
    "postSlice":       { "enabled": true, "silentDeltaThreshold": 5, "warnDeltaThreshold": 10, "scoreFloor": 70 },
    "preAgentHandoff": { "enabled": true, "injectContext": true, "runRegressionGuard": true, "cacheMaxAgeMinutes": 30, "minAlertSeverity": "medium" },
    "preCommit": {
      "chain": [
        { "name": "master-branch-reject", "command": "node .github/hooks/PreCommit.mjs master-branch-reject" },
        { "name": "diff-classify", "command": "node .github/hooks/PreCommit.mjs diff-classify" }
      ]
    }
  },
  "network": { "allowed": ["models.github.ai", "api.x.ai", "api.openai.com", "api.anthropic.com"] },
  "tools": { "deny": [] },
  "openclaw": { "endpoint": "https://your-openclaw-instance", "apiKey": "see .forge/secrets.json" }
}
```

Worker Guardrails configuration reference (v3.6.3):

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `network.allowed` | Domain allowlist for outbound connections. Current mode is log-only (`PFORGE_NETWORK_LOG_ONLY=1`), so hosts are recorded per slice without blocking. |
| `tools.deny` | Tool denylist — MCP tool names the orchestrator strips from the worker session (`tool-denied` if a denied tool is attempted). |
| `hooks.preCommit.chain` | Ordered check chain before every commit during `pforge run-plan`. Built-ins begin with `master-branch-reject` and `diff-classify`; first non-zero exit aborts the chain. |

## Pipeline (6 Steps)

| Step | Name | Prompt | Agent | Description |
|------|------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Specify | `step0-specify-feature.prompt.md` | Specifier | Define what and why |
| 1 | Preflight | `step1-preflight-check.prompt.md` | — | Verify prerequisites |
| 2 | Harden | `step2-harden-plan.prompt.md` | Plan Hardener | Lock spec into execution contract |
| 3 | Execute | `step3-execute-slice.prompt.md` | Executor | Build slice-by-slice (or `pforge run-plan`) |
| 4 | Sweep | `step4-completeness-sweep.prompt.md` | — | Eliminate TODO/stub markers |
| 5 | Review | `step5-review-gate.prompt.md` | Reviewer Gate | Independent audit |

Session isolation: Steps 0-2 (Session 1) → Steps 3-4 (Session 2) → Step 5 (Session 3)

## Plan Format

```markdown
### Slice 1: Title [depends: Slice 2] [P] [scope: src/auth/**]
**Build command**: `dotnet build`
**Test command**: `dotnet test`

**Tasks**:
1. Create the service
2. Add validation

**Validation Gate**:
```bash
dotnet build
dotnet test
```
```

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `[P]` | Parallel-eligible — runs concurrently with other `[P]` slices |
| `[depends: Slice N]` | Waits for Slice N to complete |
| `[scope: path/**]` | Restricts worker to these paths, enables conflict detection |

Plan frontmatter keys:

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `network.allowed` | Outbound host allowlist for a slice. When present, the orchestrator starts the network proxy in log-only mode (`PFORGE_NETWORK_LOG_ONLY=1`) and records contacted hostnames per slice. |
| `lockHash` | SHA-256 of the plan file at the time it was hardened. Mismatches (`lock-hash-mismatch`) abort execution to prevent running a stale plan against changed code. |
| `tools.deny` | MCP tool denylist applied at worker-session init. Denied tools are removed from the worker's visible tool list and attempted use surfaces `tool-denied`. |

## Guardrails (16-18 per preset)

Auto-loading instruction files in `.github/instructions/`:

| Domain | File | Loads When |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Architecture | `architecture-principles.instructions.md` | All files |
| Context Management | `context-fuel.instructions.md` | All files |
| Security | `security.instructions.md` | Auth, middleware, API files |
| Database | `database.instructions.md` | Data access, migration files |
| Testing | `testing.instructions.md` | Test files |
| API Patterns | `api-patterns.instructions.md` | Controller, endpoint files |
| Error Handling | `errorhandling.instructions.md` | Exception, error files |
| Performance | `performance.instructions.md` | Hot paths, query files |
| Naming | `naming.instructions.md` | All files |
| + 9 more | See preset directory | Per `applyTo` pattern |

### Temper Guards & Warning Signs

Every instruction file includes two defensive sections:

- **Temper Guards** — tables of common shortcuts agents take that still produce compiling code but erode quality (e.g., "This is too simple to test" → "Simple code gets modified later. The test documents the contract."). Named after the metallurgical process — tempering strengthens steel against brittle failure.
- **Warning Signs** — observable behavioral patterns indicating the file's guidance is being violated (e.g., "Controller contains database queries", "Empty catch block"). Helps agents self-monitor during execution and reviewers catch violations during audit.

## Agents (~12 per install: 5 pipeline + 6-7 stack-specific + audit-classifier-reviewer)

**Stack-specific (6)**: architecture-reviewer, database-reviewer, deploy-helper, performance-analyzer, security-reviewer, test-runner

**Cross-stack (8)**: accessibility-reviewer, api-contract-reviewer, cicd-reviewer, compliance-reviewer, dependency-reviewer, error-handling-reviewer, multi-tenancy-reviewer, observability-reviewer

**Pipeline (6)**: specifier → preflight → plan-hardener → executor → reviewer-gate → shipper

**Health (1)**: plan-health-auditor — read-only agent that analyzes plan health: slice sizing, gate coverage, missing forbidden actions, scope contract completeness. Invoked via `forge_delegate_to_agent` or directly from the Dashboard Agents tab.

**AI Tool Adapters**: `pforge init -Agent <tool>` generates adapter files for each platform:

| Adapter | Files Generated | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| `copilot` | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Default — always included |
| `claude` | `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/commands/planforge/*.md` | Claude Code slash commands |
| `cursor` | `.cursorrules`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | Cursor rules + commands |
| `windsurf` | `.windsurfrules`, `.windsurf/workflows/*.md` | Windsurf rules + workflows |
| `codex` | `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/context.md` | OpenAI Codex context |
| `gemini` | `GEMINI.md`, `.gemini/commands/planforge/*.toml`, `.gemini/settings.json` | Gemini CLI commands + MCP config |
| `generic` | `.ai/instructions.md`, `.ai/commands/` | Any AI tool (configurable dir) |
| `all` | All of the above | Full multi-tool support |

## Skills (18 unique IDs — 10-11 per preset + 6 shared)

Every skill follows the [Skill Blueprint](SKILL-BLUEPRINT.md) format: Frontmatter → Trigger → Steps → Safety Rules → Temper Guards → Warning Signs → Exit Proof → Persistent Memory.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/database-migration` | Generate, review, test, deploy schema migrations |
| `/staging-deploy` | Build, push, migrate, deploy, verify |
| `/test-sweep` | Run all test suites, aggregate results |
| `/dependency-audit` | Vulnerabilities, outdated, license issues |
| `/security-audit` | OWASP scan, dependency CVEs, secret leak detection, hardening report |
| `/code-review` | Architecture, security, testing, patterns |
| `/release-notes` | Generate from git history + CHANGELOG |
| `/api-doc-gen` | OpenAPI spec generation + validation |
| `/onboarding` | New developer setup walkthrough |
| `/health-check` | Forge diagnostic: smith → validate → sweep |
| `/forge-execute` | Guided plan execution: list → estimate → execute → report |
| `/forge-troubleshoot` | Diagnose and resolve plan failures, gate errors, and environment issues |
| `/forge-quench` | Reduce code complexity while preserving behavior — Chesterton's Fence |

## Telemetry

Per-run in `.forge/runs/<timestamp>/`:

| File | Format | Content |
|------|--------|---------|
| `trace.json` | OTLP JSON | Spans (SERVER/INTERNAL/CLIENT), events with severity, resource context |
| `manifest.json` | JSON | Artifact registry — lists all files in the run |
| `run.json` | JSON | Run metadata (plan, model, mode, sliceCount) |
| `summary.json` | JSON | Aggregate results, cost breakdown, sweep/analyze scores |
| `slice-N.json` | JSON | Per-slice result (status, tokens, gate output, attempts) |
| `slice-N-log.txt` | Text | Full worker stdout/stderr session log |
| `events.log` | Text | Timestamped lifecycle events |

Global: `.forge/runs/index.jsonl` — append-only run index for instant lookup

Severity levels: TRACE(1), DEBUG(5), INFO(9), WARN(13), ERROR(17), FATAL(21)

## Cost Tracking

- 23-model pricing table (Claude, GPT, Gemini)
- Per-slice token counts from worker stderr stats
- `.forge/cost-history.json` — aggregate across runs
- `forge_cost_report` MCP tool / `GET /api/cost`
- `--estimate` uses historical averages when available
- `--estimate --quorum` shows overhead breakdown per quorum-eligible slice

## Quorum Mode

Multi-model consensus: dispatch complex slices to 3 AI models for independent dry-run analysis, then a reviewer synthesizes the best approach.

```
slice → scoreComplexity (1-10)
          ├─ score < threshold → normal execution
          └─ score ≥ threshold → quorumDispatch
                    ├─ Claude Opus 4.6  → dry-run plan  ─┐
                    ├─ GPT-5.3-Codex    → dry-run plan  ─┼─ Promise.all() (parallel)
                    └─ Grok 4.20        → dry-run plan  ─┘
                              ↓
                    quorumReview (synthesis — pick best approach per file)
                              ↓
                    spawnWorker (enhanced prompt) → gate ✓
```

| Signal | Weight | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| File scope count | 20% | `[scope:]` patterns in slice header |
| Cross-module deps | 20% | `[depends:]` tag count |
| Security keywords | 15% | auth, token, RBAC, encryption, JWT, etc. |
| Database keywords | 15% | migration, schema, ALTER, CREATE TABLE, etc. |
| Gate line count | 10% | Lines in validation gate |
| Task count | 10% | Number of tasks in slice |
| Historical failures | 10% | Past failure rate from `.forge/runs/` |

Config (`.forge.json`):
```json
{
  "quorum": {
    "enabled": false,
    "auto": true,
    "threshold": 7,
    "models": ["claude-opus-4.6", "gpt-5.3-codex", "grok-4.20-0309-reasoning"],
    "reviewerModel": "claude-opus-4.6",
    "dryRunTimeout": 300000
  }
}
```

- `strictAvailability: false` (default) — drop unavailable models with a warning, continue if ≥1 remain
- `strictAvailability: true` — fast-fail (exit 2) if *any* configured model is unavailable
- Zero available models always fast-fails regardless of this setting

CLI: `--quorum` (all slices) | `--quorum=auto` (threshold) | `--quorum-threshold N` (override) | `--quorum=power` (flagship preset) | `--quorum=speed` (fast preset)

### Quorum Presets

| Preset | Models | Reviewer | Threshold | Timeout |
|--------|--------|----------|-----------|---------|
| `power` | Claude Opus 4.6 + GPT-5.3-Codex + Grok 4.20 Reasoning | Claude Opus 4.6 | 5 | 5 min |
| `speed` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 + GPT-5.4-mini + Grok 4.1 Fast Reasoning | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | 7 | 2 min |

Use via CLI (`--quorum=power`), MCP (`quorum: "power"`), or config (`.forge.json` → `quorum.preset: "power"`).

Degradation: <2 successful dry-runs → falls back to normal execution. Reviewer failure → uses best single response.

### A/B Test Results (Invoice Engine — rate tiers, discounts, tax, banker's rounding)

| Metric | Standard | Quorum (3 models) | Delta |
|--------|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Pass rate | 4/4 | 4/4 | Tie |
| Duration | 12 min | 32 min | +168% |
| Tests generated | 15 | **18** | **+20%** |
| Code structure | Inline | **Extracted helpers** | Better |
| Test robustness | Hardcoded dates | **Relative dates** | Better |
| Edge cases | Standard | **+voided regen, +sequence** | Better |

## Memory Layers

Plan Forge uses three distinct memory systems. Each has a specific role in the 3-session pipeline:

| Layer | What It Is | Scope | Managed By | Best For |
|-------|-----------|-------|------------|---------|
| **Copilot Memory** | Built-in `/memories/` note storage (user / session / repo scopes) | User / Session / Repo | Copilot Chat natively | Free-form notes, personal patterns, ad-hoc insights |
| **Plan Forge Session Bridge** | Structured `/memories/repo/current-phase.md` + `lessons-learned.md` | Repository | You (via pipeline prompts) | Carrying Session 1 → 2 → 3 state through the hardening pipeline |
| **OpenBrain** | Semantic vector memory via MCP `search_thoughts` / `capture_thought` | Global (workspace-agnostic) | OpenBrain MCP server | Auto-injecting relevant prior decisions before each slice begins |

All three are complementary. A typical phase uses all three: Copilot Memory for quick notes, the session bridge files for structured handoffs, and OpenBrain for surfacing past decisions automatically without manual prompting.

See [COPILOT-VSCODE-GUIDE.md#memory-layers](COPILOT-VSCODE-GUIDE.md#memory-layers) for the full usage guide.

## OpenBrain Memory (Optional)

When configured (`.vscode/mcp.json` includes `openbrain`), the orchestrator injects prior decisions and conventions as context before each slice begins — bridging the 3-session model with long-term semantic memory.

| Hook | When | What |
|------|------|------|
| Before slice | Worker prompt injection | `search_thoughts` — prior conventions injected as context |
| After slice | Worker prompt injection | `capture_thought` — decisions recorded for future slices |
| After run | Summary field | `_memoryCapture` with run summary + cost anomaly |

Key OpenBrain tools: `search_thoughts`, `capture_thought`, `capture_thoughts`, `thought_stats`

## Presets

| Preset | Instructions | Agents | Prompts | Skills |

## Bridge (External Notifications)

The Plan Forge Bridge connects the WebSocket hub to external platforms, dispatching run events as notifications. Configured in `.forge.json` under the `bridge` key.

**Supported channels**: Telegram, Slack, Discord, generic webhooks

**Notification levels** (hierarchical — each level includes the ones below):

| Level | Events |
|-------|--------|
| `all` | run-started, slice-started, slice-completed, slice-failed, run-completed, run-aborted |
| `important` | run-started, slice-failed, run-completed, run-aborted |
| `critical` | slice-failed, run-aborted (+ run-completed with failures) |

**Config (`.forge.json`)**:
```json
{
  "bridge": {
    "enabled": true,
    "channels": [
      { "type": "telegram", "url": "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/sendMessage", "chatId": "<CHAT_ID>", "level": "important" },
      { "type": "slack",    "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/...", "level": "all" },
      { "type": "discord",  "url": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...", "level": "critical" },
      { "type": "webhook",  "url": "https://your-endpoint.example.com/hook", "level": "all" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Rate limit: 1 notification per 5 seconds per channel (anti-spam). Bridge reconnects automatically after disconnect.

Start the bridge: `node pforge-mcp/bridge.mjs` (or via dashboard standalone mode).

## CI/CD Hook Event

The `ci-triggered` event is emitted when a CI workflow is dispatched from a plan run, enabling external integrations to react when CI is started.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `workflow` | Workflow file name or ID |
| `ref` | Git ref (branch name or SHA) |
| `inputs` | Workflow dispatch input parameters |

The event is observable via the WebSocket hub (`GET /api/hub`) or captured in the run's `events.log` file. The `slice-escalated` event is emitted separately when a slice is re-routed to a new model via the escalation chain.

## Auto-Update

`pforge smith` automatically checks for a newer Plan Forge release:

- Fetches `VERSION` from the GitHub source tree with a 5 s timeout
- Result cached in `.forge/version-check.json` for 24 hours
- Warns: `⚠ New version available: vX.Y.Z → run pforge update`
- Silent when offline (network errors are suppressed)

### Upgrading (preferred paths)

Run `pforge self-update` to pull the latest tagged release from GitHub — this is the recommended path for existing installs. Do **not** re-clone the Plan Forge repo just to upgrade; that's the first-time install path.

```
pforge self-update --force        # overwrites framework files with latest GitHub release
pforge update                     # v2.56.0+ auto-mode: newer of sibling vs. GitHub tag
pforge update --from-github       # explicit GitHub release source
```

Both commands preserve `.forge.json`, `copilot-instructions.md`, project principles, and plan files. See `pforge config get update-source` (v2.56.0+) for the update-source preference (`auto` | `github-tags` | `local-sibling`).

## LiveGuard — Post-Coding Intelligence (v2.27.0–v2.28.0)

LiveGuard is the operational intelligence layer that activates after the forge pipeline ships code. While the build pipeline (Chapters 1–14) focuses on writing correct, tested, guardrailed code, LiveGuard watches what happens after — catching drift, secrets, environment divergence, incidents, and regressions before they become production failures.

### LiveGuard MCP Tools (v2.27.0 — 9 tools)

| Tool | Guards | Data Store |
|------|--------|------------|
| `forge_drift_report` | Architecture drift vs. plan baseline | `.forge/drift-history.json` |
| `forge_incident_capture` | Incident log, MTTR, on-call tracking | `.forge/incidents/*.json` |
| `forge_dep_watch` | Dependency vulnerability change detection | `.forge/deps-snapshot.json` |
| `forge_regression_guard` | Validation gate pass/fail history | `.forge/regression-gates.json` |
| `forge_runbook` | Operational runbook store and retrieval | `.forge/runbooks/*.md` |
| `forge_hotspot` | High-churn / high-failure file detection | `.forge/hotspot-cache.json` |
| `forge_health_trend` | Long-term health trend + MTTBF scoring | `.forge/health-trend.json` |
| `forge_alert_triage` | Cross-signal ranked alert list | `.forge/alert-triage-cache.json` |
| `forge_deploy_journal` | Deploy log with pre/post health delta | `.forge/deploy-journal.jsonl` |

### LiveGuard MCP Tools (v2.28.0 — 2 additional tools)

| Tool | Guards | Security Notes |
|------|--------|----------------|
| `forge_secret_scan` | High-entropy string detection in `git diff` staged changes | Never logs values — redacts to `<REDACTED>` in all output |
| `forge_env_diff` | Environment variable key divergence across `.env*` files | Keys-only parse — never reads values; excludes `.env.local` |

### LiveGuard MCP Tools (v2.29.0 — 2 additional tools)

| Tool | Guards | Data Store |
|------|--------|------------|
| `forge_fix_proposal` | Generates 1–2 slice fix plans from regression, drift, incident, or secret-scan failures | `docs/plans/auto/LIVEGUARD-FIX-<id>.md`, `.forge/fix-proposals.json` |
| `forge_quorum_analyze` | Assembles a structured 3-section quorum prompt (Context, Question, Voting Instruction) from any LiveGuard data source for multi-model dispatch | (no persistence — returns prompt text) |

### LiveGuard MCP Tools (v2.30.0 — 1 additional tool)

| Tool | Guards | Data Store |
|------|--------|------------|
| `forge_liveguard_run` | Composite run — executes drift + sweep + secret-scan + regression-guard + dep-watch + alert-triage + health-trend in a single call; returns unified `overallStatus` (green / yellow / red) | Writes to each underlying tool's cache |

### Watcher MCP Tools (v2.34.0 / v2.35.0 — 2 tools)

| Tool | Guards | Data Store |
|------|--------|------------|
| `forge_watch` | Read-only snapshot watcher — tails another project's pforge run, detects anomalies (10 codes), maps them to concrete next-step recommendations, writes to the **watcher's** `.forge/watch-history.jsonl` | `<watcher>/.forge/watch-history.jsonl` |
| `forge_watch_live` | Live tail — streams events from a target project for a fixed duration via the target's WebSocket hub (`.forge/server-ports.json`) when running, `events.log` polling otherwise | (ephemeral; caps at 500 events/call) |

### LiveGuard REST Endpoints (v2.27.0 — 14 new endpoints)

| Method | Path | Tool |
|--------|------|------|
| GET | `/api/drift/history` | `forge_drift_report` |
| POST | `/api/drift/check` | `forge_drift_report` |
| GET | `/api/incidents` | `forge_incident_capture` |
| POST | `/api/incidents` | `forge_incident_capture` |
| GET | `/api/deps/snapshot` | `forge_dep_watch` |
| GET | `/api/regression/gates` | `forge_regression_guard` |
| POST | `/api/regression/gates` | `forge_regression_guard` |
| GET | `/api/runbooks` | `forge_runbook` |
| GET | `/api/hotspots` | `forge_hotspot` |
| GET | `/api/health-trend` | `forge_health_trend` |
| GET | `/api/alerts/triage` | `forge_alert_triage` |
| GET | `/api/deploy/journal` | `forge_deploy_journal` |
| POST | `/api/deploy/journal` | `forge_deploy_journal` |
| GET | `/api/liveguard/events` | unified event log |

### LiveGuard REST Endpoints (v2.28.0 — 4 additional endpoints)

| Method | Path | Tool |
|--------|------|------|
| GET | `/api/secrets/scan` | `forge_secret_scan` |
| POST | `/api/secrets/scan` | `forge_secret_scan` |
| GET | `/api/env/diff` | `forge_env_diff` |
| POST | `/api/env/diff` | `forge_env_diff` |

### LiveGuard Dashboard (v2.28.0)

The existing unified dashboard at `localhost:3100/dashboard` gains a **LIVEGUARD section** (5 amber-accented tabs) separated by a visual divider from the existing FORGE section (10 blue-accented tabs, including the v2.35 **Watcher** tab). Single WebSocket, single Chart.js, no new server process.

**Dashboard sections after v2.35.0 (26 tabs total)**:

| Section | Tabs | Active Color |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| FORGE | Progress, Runs, Cost, Actions, Replay, Extensions, Config, Traces, Skills, **Watcher**, **GitHub** | Blue (`#3b82f6`) |
| LIVEGUARD | Health, Incidents, Triage, Security, Env | Amber (`#f59e0b`) |

Each LiveGuard tab includes a `Docs ↗` link to the corresponding manual chapter.

### LiveGuard Telemetry

Every LiveGuard tool call writes to `.forge/liveguard-events.jsonl` and broadcasts a `liveguard-tool-completed` hub event. Structure mirrors the existing plan-run telemetry (OTLP-compatible, Severity constants from `telemetry.mjs`).

**Manual documentation**: See [Plan Forge Manual — Act IV](manual/what-is-liveguard.html) (Chapters 15–17 + Appendix F).

## Dual-Publish Extensions

`pforge ext publish <path>` validates the extension and outputs two catalog entries simultaneously:

- **Plan Forge catalog entry** — `catalog.json` format, installable with `pforge ext install`
- **Spec Kit-compatible entry** — `extensions.json` format for the Spec Kit extension registry

Extensions marked `speckit_compatible: true` in their `extension.json` work in both tools. See `extensions/PUBLISHING.md` for the full dual-publish workflow.
