/**
 * Issue #264 — a worker that never launched was recorded as a validation gate
 * failure, sending diagnosis to entirely the wrong place.
 *
 * The measured run (a consumer project's slice 5, two orchestrators in separate
 * worktrees) looked like this:
 *
 *   slice-5-log.txt   STDOUT: (empty)
 *                     STDERR: The process cannot access the file
 *                             '...copilotCli\copilot.ps1' because it is being
 *                             used by another process.
 *                             + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException
 *
 *   slice-5.json      status:       failed
 *                     gateStatus:   failed
 *                     statusReason: validation gate failed: pnpm --filter
 *                                   @my-app/api exec vitest run ...
 *                     gateError:    No test files found, exiting with code 1
 *
 * Every signal named vitest and a test path. The cause was a Windows file lock
 * on a shared CLI entrypoint.
 *
 * The gap was precise. detectSilentWorkerFailure (Issue #77) covers the
 * exit-ZERO case and returns early on `exitCode !== 0`, so empty stdout with a
 * non-zero exit — a process that never started — fell straight through to the
 * gate, which then truthfully reported the absence of work nobody had done.

/**
 * The contention half. A lock on the shared `copilot.ps1` entrypoint is
 * transient by nature, so the reporter asked for a retry with backoff, and
 * #264 was closed on the belief that it "comes for free: a skipped gate leaves
 * gateResult.success false, so the existing retry loop takes another attempt."
 *
 * It does not. `detectWorkerLaunchFailure` only fires when `exitCode !== 0`,
 * and the attempt loop reaches an unconditional
 *
 *     if (workerResult.exitCode !== 0) break;
 *
 * before any retry bookkeeping — so a launch failure always left the loop on
 * attempt 0 and the transient lock was never retried.
