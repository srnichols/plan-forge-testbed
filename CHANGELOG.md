## [2.96.3] — 2026-05-17 — Background-Run Diagnostics + Analyze Score Recovery (Issues #188, #189)

> **One-liner**: Closes two more bugs surfaced by the v2.96.2 verification rerun: background-mode runs now leave a diagnostic stdout/stderr trail when they crash, and the auto-analyze rollup recovers the consistency score even when `pforge analyze` exits 1 as a below-threshold warning.

#### Fixed — Issue #188: `pforge run-plan` background mode — orchestrator dies silently with no captured stderr
- `pforge.ps1` background branch (around line 4205) and `pforge.sh` background branch (around line 3520) previously spawned the orchestrator via `Start-Process -NoNewWindow` (PS) / `node ... &` (bash) with **no stdout/stderr redirection**. The child inherited the parent shell's console handles; when the wrapper exited 0 immediately after spawning, the child's next write to stdout could EPIPE and crash node with zero captured output.
- Both wrappers now redirect stdout and stderr to timestamped log files under `.forge/orchestrator-logs/orch-<UTC>.{stdout,stderr}.log` and (on Windows) use `-WindowStyle Hidden` to fully detach the child from the parent console. On bash, `nohup ... </dev/null & disown` provides the same isolation.
- New `Stdout` and `Stderr` lines in the banner tell the operator where to look when a background run goes silent.
- `pforge.sh` also now writes `.forge/last-orch.pid` (it was previously PowerShell-only), so `pforge status` and chain runners can attach on Linux/macOS.

#### Fixed — Issue #189: `runAutoAnalyze` discards score when `pforge analyze` exits 1 as a below-threshold warning
- `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` `runAutoAnalyze` previously caught any non-zero exit from `pforge analyze` and returned `{ ran: true, score: null, error: "Command failed: ..." }` — even though the analyze CLI prints the full `Consistency Score: NN/100` to stdout before exiting 1 as a below-threshold *warning signal*.
- The catch block now inspects `err.stdout` and recovers the score when parseable. The summary now records `{ ran: true, score: <NN>, output, exitCode: 1, warning: "analyze exited 1 (score NN below threshold)" }`, which keeps `forge_drift_report` and `forge_health_trend` rollups accurate.
- The `analyze.output` field is also preserved on the error path so genuine crashes (timeout, missing wrapper) still produce a diagnostic trail.
- Extracted the regex into exported `parseAnalyzeScore(output)` — 13 new tests in `tests/auto-analyze-issue-189.test.mjs` cover real testbed stdout (55/100), happy path (75/100), perfect score (100/100), alternate `Score: NN` format, multi-score outputs (headline wins), case-insensitivity, zero score, plus null/undefined/empty/non-string inputs and the three return-shape contracts (success/warning/error).

## [2.96.2] — 2026-05-17 — Testbed-Rerun Polish (Issues #186–#187)

> **One-liner**: Closes two more bugs surfaced by the v2.96.1 verification rerun: per-slice telemetry fields (`vendor`, `sessionDurationMs`, `codeChanges`) now populate even when the CLI worker omits them, and the background-run banner points at the real `pforge status` command.

#### Fixed — Issue #186: worker token telemetry — `vendor=unknown`, `apiDurationMs=0`, `sessionDurationMs=0`, `codeChanges=null` on every slice
- `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs`:
  - New exported helper `deriveVendorFromModel(model)` — maps `claude-*` → `anthropic`, `gpt-* / o1-* / o3-* / o4-*` → `openai`, `grok-*` → `xai`, `gemini-*` → `google`. Applied at the end of `spawnWorker` only when `tokens.vendor` is missing or `"unknown"`. Safe wrt v2.83.0 Forbidden Action #1: `priceSlice()` selects the subscription-CLI branch on `worker` and short-circuits before reading vendor, so cost math is unchanged for CLI workers.
  - `spawnWorker` now anchors `_spawnStartMs = Date.now()` immediately after `spawn()` and uses it as a fallback for `tokens.sessionDurationMs` when the JSONL `result` event omits `usage.sessionDurationMs` (gh-copilot currently does).
  - `autoCommitSliceIfDirty` now calls `git show --shortstat --format= <sha>` after a successful commit and attaches `codeChanges: { filesChanged, linesAdded, linesRemoved }` to both the `slice-auto-committed` event and the return value. Errors leave `codeChanges` null — never blocks the commit path.
  - New exported helper `parseShortstat(shortstat)` parses git's summary line (handles singular/plural, insertions-only, deletions-only, leading blank lines, multi-line output with diagnostics).
  - `executeSliceWithRetries` bubbles `result.autoCommit.codeChanges` into `result.tokens.codeChanges` when the worker telemetry didn't surface it. Downstream consumers (`forge_drift_report`, `forge_health_trend`) now see real numbers instead of nulls.
- 17 new tests in `tests/telemetry-issue-186.test.mjs` cover `deriveVendorFromModel` (7 cases) and `parseShortstat` (8 cases) plus edge cases.
- `apiDurationMs` remains 0 by design — gh-copilot does not expose API-call wall-clock separately from session wall-clock; documented in the source comment.

#### Fixed — Issue #187: `pforge plan-status` referenced in run-plan banner but command does not exist
- `pforge.ps1` and `pforge.sh` background-run banner now prints `Monitor : pforge status` (the actual command). Previously the user got `ERROR: Unknown command 'plan-status'` if they followed the printed instruction.

## [2.96.1] — 2026-05-17 — Testbed Bug Sweep (Issues #177–#183)

> **One-liner**: Closes seven framework bugs surfaced by the aggressive Phase-4 testbed exercise: critical operator-WIP data loss, cost-rollup zeroing, .slnx stack detection, planPath flag parsing, summary.quorumMode separation, BOM regression test, and stale-wrapper warning. All fixes are TDD-backed; no behavior change outside the bug surfaces.

#### Fixed — Issue #178 (CRITICAL): orchestrator stash never popped — operator WIP silently lost
- `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` `executeSlice` was calling `git stash push` on operator's uncommitted work before each slice but **never** calling `git stash pop`. Operator edits silently accumulated in `git stash list` after every run.
- Extracted the stash logic into testable `pushSliceSnapshot()` and `popSliceSnapshot()` helpers. Pop now runs in both success and failure paths, with conflicts surfaced as a non-fatal `snapshot-restore-failed` event plus a `snapshotRestoreError` field on the slice result.
- Recovery for any user hit by the pre-fix bug: `git stash list` and `git stash apply stash@{0}`.

#### Fixed — Issue #180: cost rollup zero despite successful CLI run
- `parseStderrStats` was correctly extracting `Tokens ↑ 22.1k • ↓ 689` from gh-copilot stderr, but the `premiumRequests` fallback at the end of `spawnWorker` only fired when `stdout.length > 200`. Since gh-copilot writes most output to **stderr**, slices with short stdout reported `cost_usd: 0` even when stderr clearly showed token activity.
- Extracted heuristic into exported `shouldDefaultPremiumRequestsToOne({ tokens, stdout, stderr, code, timedOut })`. Now bumps premiumRequests to 1 when stdout is long, when token counts were parsed from stderr, OR when stderr contains a recognizable `Tokens` header (Unicode `↑↓•` or ASCII `^v*` fallback).
- 10 new tests in `tests/cost-rollup-issue-180.test.mjs` pin the regex against real testbed stderr and exercise the helper across 8 paths.

#### Fixed — Issue #181: `pforge run-plan --quorum=power plan.md` crashed
- `pforge.ps1 Invoke-RunPlan` unconditionally took `$Arguments[0]` as the plan path. With flags before the plan, the flag was treated as the plan path and `Test-Path` failed.
- Now scans all args for the first non-flag token, skipping value-consuming flags (`--model`, `--worker`, `--resume-from`, `--quorum-threshold`, `--manual-import-source`, `--manual-import-reason`, `--only-slices`). Flag order is now arbitrary.

#### Fixed — Issue #182: `summary.mode` conflated worker mode and quorum mode
- `summary.json` reported `mode: "auto"` both for single-model auto runs and for `--quorum=power` runs, breaking cost attribution and historical filtering.
- Added `quorumMode` (`"auto" | "power" | "speed" | "all" | "false"`) and `quorumPreset` fields to `summary.json`, populated from `runMeta`. `mode` continues to mean `"auto" | "assisted"` (worker execution mode).

#### Fixed — Issue #183: stack detector missed `.slnx` and `src/Project/Project.csproj` layouts
- `tempering.mjs detectStack` only scanned the root directory for `.csproj | .sln | .fsproj`, missing modern .NET solutions that keep projects under `src/Project/`. Also missed `.slnx` (VS 17.10+ XML format) and `.vbproj`.
- Now scans root + one and two levels deep, with `node_modules / .git / bin / obj / .*` excluded. Accepts `.slnx`, `.sln`, `.csproj`, `.fsproj`, `.vbproj` as dotnet markers.
- 6 new tests cover .slnx detection, recursive scanning, and node_modules exclusion.

#### Fixed — Issue #179: BOM regression guard
- Added `tests/wrapper-bom-issue-179.test.mjs` that asserts `pforge.ps1` and `validate-setup.ps1` start with the UTF-8 BOM (`EF BB BF`). Without BOM, PowerShell 5.1 falls back to Windows-1252 and Unicode glyphs (`✓ ╔ ↑ ↓ •`) render as garbage.

#### Fixed — Issue #177: stale-wrapper warning on `pforge update`
- The v2.95.0+ wrapper already syncs `pforge.ps1` / `pforge.sh` / `VERSION` in the update loop, but PowerShell continues executing the OLD in-memory wrapper code for the rest of the session.
- `Invoke-Update` now tracks whether the running wrapper was self-replaced and prints a clear warning telling the operator to open a new terminal before running additional commands. The bash side already had this warning at `pforge.sh:1721`.

#### Tests
- New test files: `tests/slice-snapshot.test.mjs` (10 tests), `tests/cost-rollup-issue-180.test.mjs` (18 tests), `tests/wrapper-bom-issue-179.test.mjs` (2 tests).
- Extended: `tests/tempering-foundation.test.mjs` (+6 tests for .slnx + recursion).

## [2.96.0] — 2026-05-16 — Cost-Service Token Coverage (Phase-COST-TOKEN-COVERAGE)

> **One-liner**: Fixes Plan Forge cost accounting for cache_read, Anthropic cache writes, reasoning-token coverage, and OpenAI service tiers while preserving the separate Subscription CLI workers premium-request path.

#### Fixed — vendor-aware token accounting in `pforge-mcp/cost-service.mjs`
- `priceSlice()` now distinguishes Anthropic vs. OpenAI/xAI cache semantics, bills `cache_read` with per-model multipliers, preserves `reasoning_tokens` as informational-only, and records a `cost_breakdown` payload for downstream reports.
- `MODEL_PRICING` refreshed with corrected base rates, added missing GPT-5 / Opus / Grok entries, and now carries cache and service-tier multipliers with `_source` provenance.
- xAI responses now honor `cost_in_usd_ticks` as the authoritative billed amount when present.

#### Fixed — provider token extraction
- `pforge-master/src/providers/anthropic-tools.mjs`, `openai-tools.mjs`, and `xai-tools.mjs` now extract cache, reasoning, and `service_tier` metadata needed for accurate direct-API billing.
- `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` keeps CLI-derived token extraction on the legacy `vendor: 'unknown'` path so Subscription CLI workers remain unchanged.

#### Tests
- Added coverage for cache_read, cache creation, reasoning-token, xAI authoritative-ticks, and service-tier math plus parseResponse extraction regressions for Anthropic / OpenAI / xAI.
- Full `pforge-mcp` vitest suite re-run after the Phase-COST-TOKEN-COVERAGE changes.

## [2.95.1] — 2026-05-16 — Hotfix: scoreSliceComplexity recalibration

> **One-liner**: Recalibrates the `scoreSliceComplexity` scoring formula so that medium-complexity slices (3 files in scope, 3 gate lines, 4–6 tasks) now score at or above the default quorum threshold of 5, making quorum auto-mode actually trigger on real-world plans. Addresses the v2.61.0 research finding that threshold 5 selected zero slices across all plans in the repo. No behavior change for simple or maximally-complex slices — both boundary tests still hold.

#### Fixed
- **`pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` `scoreSliceComplexity`** — Recalibrated normalization denominators for all six continuous signals so that a medium-complexity slice (the kind that should attract quorum review) reaches the threshold:
  - `scopeCount / 5 → / 3` — 3 files in scope saturates the signal (was 5)
  - `depCount / 4 → / 3` — 3 cross-module dependencies saturates the signal (was 4)
  - `securityHits / 3 → / 2` — 2 security-keyword hits saturates the signal (was 3)
  - `dbHits / 3 → / 2` — 2 database-keyword hits saturates the signal (was 3)
  - `gateLines / 5 → / 3` — 3-line validation gate saturates the signal (was 5)
  - `taskCount / 10 → / 6` — 6 tasks saturates the signal (was 10)
- **`pforge-mcp/tests/analyzer.test.mjs`** — Updated test description to reflect the new saturation point: "caps scopeWeight at 1 for 3+ files" (was "5+ files"). All 5272 tests pass.

#### Notes
- Before this fix, a representative real-plan slice (3 files, 1 dep, 3 gate lines, 4 tasks, no security/DB keywords) scored **3** — below the `power` preset threshold of 5. After recalibration it scores **5**, putting it exactly at the threshold. More complex slices score 6–9 as intended.
- The `cost-service-real-plans.test.mjs` invariant test auto-adapts: it recomputes expected quorum count using the same recalibrated `scoreSliceComplexity`, so no hardcoded expected values needed updating.
- Closes the backlog item from the v2.61.0 research report: "threshold 5 selects zero slices on real plans".

## [2.95.0] — 2026-05-16 — Phase Lattice: code-graph indexing, Anvil caching, hallmark provenance

> **One-liner**: Introduces the Lattice code-graph engine (semantic chunk index + BFS call-graph traversal), the Anvil memoization cache (content-hash-keyed, with DLQ recovery), and the Hallmark provenance SDK — five new CLI commands (`pforge lattice`, `pforge anvil`), ten new MCP tools, and a new `pforge-sdk/hallmark` sub-path export.

#### Added — Lattice code-graph engine (`pforge lattice`)
- **`pforge-mcp/lattice/`** — New module implementing the Lattice code-graph indexer. Produces `.forge/lattice/chunks.jsonl` (semantic code chunks) and `.forge/lattice/edges.jsonl` (call-graph edges) for any git repository. Supports a pure-JS chunker with optional tree-sitter upgrade for precise boundary detection.
- **`pforge lattice index [--since <sha>]`** — Build or update the Lattice chunk index. `--since` enables incremental re-indexing from a git SHA (Anvil hit-rate optimization).
- **`pforge lattice stat`** — Show index statistics: chunk count, edge count, language breakdown, Anvil hit rate, index size.
- **`pforge lattice query [--query <q>] [--language <l>] [--kind <k>] [--limit <n>]`** — Full-text search over the chunk index; returns bounded 80-char snippets.
- **`pforge lattice callers <name> [--limit <n>]`** — Find all callers of a named symbol using the edge graph.
- **`pforge lattice blast <name> [--direction <callees|callers|both>] [--depth <n>]`** — BFS call-graph traversal up to depth 5; returns `truncated: true` when the frontier is capped.
- **MCP tools** — `forge_lattice_index`, `forge_lattice_stat`, `forge_lattice_query`, `forge_lattice_callers`, `forge_lattice_blast` (five new tools, all `addedIn: "2.95.0"`).

#### Added — Anvil memoization cache (`pforge anvil`)
- **`pforge-mcp/anvil/`** — Content-hash-keyed memoization layer that prevents re-indexing unchanged files across `lattice index` runs. Stores cached results in `.forge/anvil/cache.jsonl`; failed entries land in a dead-letter queue (`.forge/anvil/dlq.jsonl`) for inspection and retry.
- **`pforge anvil stat`** — Show cache statistics: total entries, DLQ size, hit/miss ratio.
- **`pforge anvil clear [--file <path>]`** — Evict one file or the entire cache.
- **`pforge anvil rebuild --since <sha>`** — Evict all cache entries for files changed since a git SHA, then trigger a fresh index.
- **`pforge anvil dlq list [--limit <n>]`** — List dead-letter-queue entries.
- **`pforge anvil dlq drain [--limit <n>]`** — Retry DLQ entries and remove those that succeed.
- **MCP tools** — `forge_anvil_stat`, `forge_anvil_clear`, `forge_anvil_rebuild`, `forge_anvil_dlq_list`, `forge_anvil_dlq_drain` (five new tools, all `addedIn: "2.95.0"`).

#### Added — Hallmark provenance contract (`pforge-sdk`)
- **`pforge-sdk/src/hallmark.mjs`** — New sub-path export (`pforge-sdk/hallmark`) providing a lightweight, dependency-free provenance contract: `HALLMARK_SCHEMA_VERSION` constant (`"hallmark/v1"`), `validateProvenance(record)` (pure validator, no throws), `buildProvenance(options)` (fills `schemaVersion` + `capturedAt` automatically), and `mergeProvenance(existingMetadata, provenance)` (non-mutating attach under the `"provenance"` key).
- **`pforge-sdk/schemas/hallmark-provenance.v1.json`** — JSON Schema defining the `hallmark/v1` envelope: required fields `schemaVersion`, `toolName`, `capturedAt`; optional `sourceFile`, `byteRange`, `contentHash`, `codeHash`, `toolVersion`; `additionalProperties: false`.
- **`pforge-sdk/README.md`** — Added "Hallmark provenance" section documenting the API, schema field table, and usage examples.
- **MCP tools** — `forge_hallmark_show` (read provenance for a file), `forge_hallmark_verify` (drift detection — compare stored provenance against current file hash). Both `addedIn: "2.95.0"`.

#### Added — Pipelines introspection
- **`forge_pipelines_list`** — New MCP tool that returns the ordered list of active pipeline capture stages. Useful for agents confirming which capture stages are enabled before a run. `addedIn: "2.95.0"`.

#### Notes
- Test suite: all passing (orchestrator-gate-dispatch + crucible-import + lattice-chunker pure-JS path). Tree-sitter tests are skipped on platforms without the grammar binary — the pure-JS fallback is the default and fully supported.
- `forge_capabilities` now reports `version: "2.95.0"` with all new tools listed.

## [2.93.3] — 2026-05-16 — Docs hotfix: manual drift audit (P1 batch + residuals)

> **One-liner**: Second batch of the manual drift audit started in v2.93.2. Resolves all 22 P1 pages flagged in [#174](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/174) (21 findings across 11 pages) plus the 5 residual items deferred from v2.93.2. Same defect class as v2.93.0 Slice 7: features documented in the manual that never shipped in code. Documentation only — no CLI, MCP tool, or schema changes.

#### Fixed — fake API endpoints / tool names
- **`docs/manual/forge-master.html`** — Removed two fabricated HTTP endpoints (`POST /api/forge-master/ask`, `POST /api/forge-master/stream`) and replaced them with the real 9-endpoint surface verified against `pforge-master/src/http-routes.mjs`: `POST /api/forge-master/chat`, `GET /api/forge-master/chat/:sessionId/stream` (SSE), `POST /api/forge-master/chat/:sessionId/approve`, `GET /api/forge-master/session/:sessionId`, `GET /api/forge-master/sessions`, `GET /api/forge-master/prompts`, `GET /api/forge-master/capabilities`, `GET /api/forge-master/cache-stats`, `GET / PUT /api/forge-master/prefs` (was incorrectly documented as `GET / POST`). Hardcoded "69 MCP tools" replaced with `<!--c:tools-->` token (now 77). Streaming-chat callout corrected to describe the two-step `POST /chat` → SSE subscribe flow.
- **`docs/manual/mcp-server-reference.html`** — Forge-Master endpoint table rewritten with the same 9 real routes (previously listed the same 2 fake `ask`/`stream` endpoints).
- **`docs/manual/dashboard-forge-master.html`** — Streaming-chat reference corrected to `POST /api/forge-master/chat` + `GET /api/forge-master/chat/:sessionId/stream`.
- **`docs/manual/health-dna.html`** — Removed two fabrications: the non-existent `forge_health_trim` MCP tool (no such entry in `tools.json`) and the non-existent `health.weights` config key (no reference in `pforge-mcp/*.mjs`). Replaced with: "the file rotates on size" (trim) and a description of the actual default weights baked into `forge_health_trend` (drift 0.30, incident-rate 0.25, test-pass 0.20, model-success 0.15, cost 0.10). Figure 23-1 alt text corrected `.forge/health-dna.json` → `.forge/health-dna.jsonl`.
- **`docs/manual/bug-registry.html`** — Status machine corrected to match the real `BUG_STATUSES` enum (`["open", "in-fix", "fixed", "wont-fix", "duplicate"]` in `pforge-mcp/tempering/bug-registry.mjs`). Removed the fabricated `validating` intermediate state — `forge_bug_validate_fix` transitions directly to `fixed` on pass (failure stays `in-fix` with attempt appended to `validationAttempts[]`). Reclassified `noise` from "terminal status" to "triage classification" (it lives in `bug.triage`, not `bug.status`). SVG diagram regen tracked for a follow-up.

#### Fixed — fake CLI subcommand syntax
- **`docs/manual/liveguard-tools.html`** — Replaced fake `pforge incident capture` / `pforge incident list` subcommands with the real CLI: `pforge incident "<description>" [--severity ...] [--files ...] [--resolved-at ISO]` (single command, no subcommands; see `pforge.ps1` L4318 / `pforge.sh` L3596). Replaced fake `pforge runbook list/get/add` with the real single command: `pforge runbook <plan-file>`. Pointed users to `pforge triage` for listing ranked open incidents. Meta description and intro corrected from "11 tools" → "14 tools" (matches the v2.30.0 callout and table). Incidents storage path corrected from `.forge/incidents/` directory → `.forge/incidents.jsonl` file (the canonical write target per `server.mjs:1297`, `capabilities.mjs:920`, `orchestrator.mjs:9072`, and the `pforge.sh:3620` manual-steps printout).
- **`docs/manual/liveguard-runbooks.html`** — Replaced fake `pforge incident list` with `pforge triage`.

#### Fixed — internal count contradictions
- **`docs/manual/liveguard-dashboard.html`** — Resolved a 5-vs-7 LiveGuard tab contradiction. The chapter prose, v2.30.0 callout, and ASCII tab-strip mock-up now all show 7 tabs (Health, Incidents, Triage, Security, Env, Watcher, Bug Registry) — matching Figure 7-1 in `dashboard.html` and the real tab structure. Incidents-tab path corrected from `.forge/incidents/` → `.forge/incidents.jsonl`.
- **`docs/manual/dashboard.html`** — LiveGuard tabs callout corrected from "5 amber-accented tabs" → "7 amber-accented tabs" with full tab list, aligning with Figure 7-1.
- **`docs/manual/agent-factory-recipe.html`** — "20 agent personas" → `<!--c:agents-->19<!--/c-->` token with the verified breakdown (6 stack-specific + 7 cross-stack + 5 pipeline + 1 audit-classifier). Pipeline-agents section count corrected `(6)` → `(5)` and the `preflight` row was removed — step 1 ships as a prompt (`step1-preflight-check.prompt.md`), not as an agent file. Instruction-files claim `~16` → `<!--c:instructions-->18<!--/c-->` token with provenance note.
- **`docs/manual/remote-bridge.html`** — Resolved a 4-vs-6 channels contradiction. Intro prose now matches Figure 20-1: 6 channels supported out of the box (Telegram, Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty, OpenClaw). Meta description updated to match.
- **`docs/manual/multi-agent.html`** — "MCP tools ✓ 18" matrix cells (which contradicted the canonical 77-tool count) reduced to a plain checkmark, since the matrix is comparing adapter completeness, not enumerating tools.
- **`docs/manual/mcp-server.html`** — "30+ endpoints" → "~100 endpoints" (real count is 96 `/api/*` routes in `server.mjs`).
- **`docs/manual/project-history.html`** — Phase 1 narrative no longer claims Plan Forge shipped Claude Code’s `SessionStart`/`PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`/`Stop` hooks. Rewritten to name the real Plan Forge lifecycle hooks (`PreDeploy`, `PreCommit`, `PreAgentHandoff`, `PostSlice` + `plan-forge.json` config) with a contrast note explaining the Claude Code mapping.
- **`docs/manual/installation.html`** — Files-created tree corrected: agents line was "8 files (7 stack-specific + 1 shared)" → "19 files (6 stack-specific + 7 cross-stack + 5 pipeline + 1 audit-classifier)".

#### Audit method
- Verified every flagged route, tool name, CLI subcommand, and config key against authoritative sources (`pforge-master/src/http-routes.mjs`, `pforge-mcp/tools.json`, `pforge-mcp/tempering/bug-registry.mjs`, `pforge.ps1` / `pforge.sh`, `pforge-mcp/server.mjs`, `pforge-mcp/capabilities.mjs`, `extensions/` directory listing) before editing the manual.
- Used the existing `<!--c:KEY-->VALUE<!--/c-->` token system (`docs/manual/assets/manual.js`) for any number that has a canonical source-of-truth, rather than hardcoding values that drift.
- Documentation maintenance script (`node docs/manual/maintain.mjs`) — 60 chapters, 217 indexed sections, 5903 internal links verified.

#### Notes
- No CLI, MCP tool, schema, or behavior change — documentation-only release.
- Test suite unchanged (31/31 pass for `orchestrator-gate-dispatch` + `crucible-import`).
- Closes [#174](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/174).

## [2.93.2] — 2026-05-16 — Docs hotfix: manual drift audit

> **One-liner**: Removes documentation drift discovered during a top-down audit of `docs/manual/*.html`. Triggered by the same class of defect that bit `spec-kit-interop.html` in v2.93.0 Slice 7 — features claimed in the manual that never shipped in code. Fixes 9 critical/high drift sites + bulk-corrects stale counts in 9 files via the `<!--c:KEY-->` token system. No code surface changes; documentation only.

#### Fixed
- **`docs/manual/cli-reference.html`** — Removed `pforge diagnose` as a fake CLI command. The `#diagnose` section, the analyze-vs-diagnose callout, and the "I'm Trying To…" use-case table now point users at the real `forge_diagnose` MCP tool. The CLI command does not exist in `pforge.ps1` or `pforge.sh`.
- **`docs/manual/quick-reference.html`** — Same `pforge diagnose` row swapped for `forge_diagnose({ file })` MCP-tool reference.
- **`docs/manual/troubleshooting.html`** — Diagnostic-tools table row updated to reference `forge_diagnose({ file })` as MCP tool, not a fake CLI command.
- **`docs/manual/mcp-server-quickstart.html`** — Three example payloads corrected against `tools.json`: `forge_diagnose({ symptom })` → `forge_diagnose({ file })`, `forge_analyze({})` → `forge_analyze({ plan })` (required field), `forge_estimate_quorum({ plan })` → `forge_estimate_quorum({ planPath })`. The workflow `ol` was updated to match.
- **`docs/manual/mcp-server-reference.html`** — Crucible tools section expanded from 6 → 8 entries; adds the v2.93.0 additions `forge_crucible_import` and `forge_crucible_status`. Hardcoded "69 / 74 MCP tools" counts switched to the `<!--c:tools-->` token (now 77).
- **`docs/manual/mcp-server.html`** — Hardcoded "69 MCP tools" replaced with `<!--c:tools-->` token (now 77) in two places.
- **`docs/manual/dashboard.html`** — Removed claim that buttons hit `/api/smith`, `/api/sweep`, etc. Those endpoints don't exist. Updated to document the real dispatcher (`POST /api/tool/:name`).
- **`docs/manual/installation.html`** — Replaced fake Claude-Code hook names (`SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop`) in the "files created" tree with Plan Forge's actual hooks (`PreDeploy`, `PreCommit`, `PreAgentHandoff`, `PostSlice`, `plan-forge.json`). Updated per-directory counts to match the dotnet preset. Added a callout explaining the distinction from Claude Code hook semantics.
- **`docs/manual/glossary.html`** — "Lifecycle Hook" definition rewritten to list Plan Forge's actual hook names; notes the distinction from Claude Code.
- **`docs/manual/github-stack-alignment.html`** — `.github/hooks/` row corrected — no longer claims Plan Forge ships `SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop` (those are Claude Code's, not Plan Forge's).
- **`docs/manual/assets/manual.js`** (`MANUAL_COUNTS` source of truth) — `tools` 74→77, `prompts` 7→8, `skills` 13→11 (dotnet preset; ts=10), `hooks` 7→5 (real Plan Forge hooks, not Claude Code names), `htmlFiles` 58→60. Comments updated. Token propagation via `node docs/manual/maintain.mjs` rewrote 14 occurrences across 9 files.

#### Audit method
- Authoritative reference: 44 real `pforge` subcommands (from `pforge help`), 77 real MCP tools (from `pforge-mcp/tools.json`), 96 `/api/*` routes (from grep of `server.mjs`), 4 real lifecycle hooks (from `.github/hooks/` + `templates/.github/hooks/`).
- Cross-referenced every `pforge <subcmd>`, `forge_<tool>`, `.forge/<path>`, and `/api/<route>` mention in P0 manual pages (cli-reference, mcp-server-*, quickstart-*, writing-plans, installation) plus 3 P1 pages (crucible, dashboard, extensions).
- 22 P1 pages remain unaudited (`forge-master`, `liveguard-*`, `multi-agent`, `dashboard-settings`, `bug-registry`, etc.) — tracked for follow-up.
- Medium/low residual drift (e.g. "30+ endpoints" understating the actual 96, internal "33 tabs" inconsistency in `dashboard.html`, narrative hook claim in `project-history.html`) deferred to a tracking issue.

#### Notes
- All maintenance-script checks pass (`node docs/manual/maintain.mjs` — 60 chapters, 217 indexed sections, 4993 internal links verified).
- Test suite unchanged (31/31 pass for `orchestrator-gate-dispatch` + `crucible-import`).
- No CLI, MCP tool, or schema changes.

## [2.93.1] — 2026-05-13 — Hotfix: WSL bash dispatch + hardener prompt rule

> **One-liner**: Fixes a Windows-specific gate dispatch bug where `runGate()` routed literal `bash -c "..."` gates through WSL bash (no Windows PATH) instead of Git Bash, causing `pwsh`/`node`/`npx` calls inside the wrap to fail with `command not found`. Also adds a Step 2 hardener prompt rule that prevents the bad pattern from being authored in the first place. Empirically observed twice on this codebase — Phase GITHUB-B (May 5) and Phase CRUCIBLE-IMPORT-CLI Slice 2 (May 13).

#### Fixed
- **`pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs`** — `runGate()` Windows path now treats `cmdName === "bash"` as a third trigger for `resolveBashPath()` dispatch (alongside `UNIX_TOOLS.includes(cmdName)` and `hasShellChain`). When the gate already starts with `bash -c "..."`, the redundant outer `bash` token is stripped and only the body is passed to `execFileSync(bashPath, ["-c", body], ...)` — no double-wrapping, no quoting collisions. Resolves [#172](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/172).
- **`.github/prompts/step2-harden-plan.prompt.md`** — New Gate Portability Rules table row: "Don't wrap allowlisted tools in `bash -c`". Documents the WSL-bash-PATH trap with the bad/good examples, references the empirical incidents, and notes that v2.93.1's runGate fix routes literal `bash -c` gates correctly even if the bad pattern slips through. Resolves [#171](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/171).

#### Added
- **`pforge-mcp/tests/orchestrator-gate-dispatch.test.mjs`** — Three new test cases covering the issue #172 fix:
  - `“on Windows, literal \`bash -c "..."\` gates route through resolveBashPath() (Git Bash)”`
  - `“on Windows, \`bash -c\` with single-quoted body strips the outer quotes too”`
  - `“on Windows, \`bash -c\` falls back to wrapping the whole command if regex doesn't match”`

#### Notes
- **Empirical signature**: `gateError: "/bin/bash: line 1: <tool>: command not found"` and `failedCommand` starts with `bash -c "..."`. Memory note `/memories/repo/plan-gate-command-rules.md` lines 52–73 documents the prior incident.
- **No user-facing API change** — plans that previously failed with this signature now succeed without modification.
- **Backward-compatible** — the new dispatch path only fires for `bash` as the first token; all other gates take the existing dispatch path unchanged.

## [2.93.0] — 2026-05-13 — Spec Kit Importer: CLI + MCP tool

> **One-liner**: Ships `pforge crucible import --from=spec-kit` CLI subcommand and two MCP tools (`forge_crucible_import`, `forge_crucible_status`) backed by a deterministic importer module (`crucible-import.mjs`) — closing the gap between the documented Spec Kit interop flow and what actually shipped. Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, and CI users now have a scriptable, non-Copilot-Chat path to import Spec Kit specs into Plan Forge plans. The `/step0-specify-feature` Spec Kit branch is refactored to call the importer instead of doing probabilistic field-mapping inside the prompt. Documentation rewritten to match shipping behavior.

### Phase-CRUCIBLE-IMPORT-CLI — Spec Kit Importer: CLI + MCP tool

> **One-liner**: Introduces a deterministic Spec Kit importer module (`pforge-mcp/crucible-import.mjs`) consumed by a new `pforge crucible` CLI subcommand (PowerShell + bash), two new MCP tools (`forge_crucible_import`, `forge_crucible_status`), and a refactored `/step0-specify-feature` Spec Kit branch that now calls the importer instead of mapping fields inside the prompt. Closes the documented-but-unshipped gap for Cursor / Claude Code / Codex users and CI pipelines. Existing Copilot Chat flow preserved and determinism-hardened.

#### Added
- `pforge-mcp/crucible-import.mjs` — Deterministic Spec Kit importer. Exports `importSpeckit({ projectRoot, dir?, dryRun?, syncPrinciples? })` returning `{ ok, smeltId, planPath, mappedFields, missingFields, warnings }`. Parses all four Spec Kit source files (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `constitution.md`) using `remark` + `remark-frontmatter` — no LLM calls. On success writes a smelt to `.forge/crucible/smelt-<uuid>.json`, a Phase Plan to `docs/plans/Phase-<NAME>-PLAN.md` (name slugified from `spec.md` title, `--name` overrides), and an audit entry to `.forge/crucible/manual-imports.jsonl`. `dryRun: true` returns the same shape without writing anything. `syncPrinciples: true` writes `constitution.md` content to `docs/plans/PROJECT-PRINCIPLES.md`; errors with `PROJECT_PRINCIPLES_EXISTS` if the file already exists.
- `pforge-mcp/tests/crucible-import.test.mjs` — Vitest unit suite (≥ 90% line coverage of `crucible-import.mjs`). Covers all four parsers, all error codes (`SPECKIT_IMPORT_MISSING_FIELD`, `SPECKIT_IMPORT_MISSING_REQUIRED`, `SPECKIT_IMPORT_DIR_NOT_FOUND`, `SPECKIT_IMPORT_AMBIGUOUS_DIR`, `PROJECT_PRINCIPLES_EXISTS`), dry-run, `syncPrinciples`, and the happy-path round-trip.
- `pforge-mcp/tests/crucible-import.e2e.test.mjs` — End-to-end Vitest suite: copies the `green/` fixture to a tmpdir, shells out to `crucible-import.mjs`, asserts smelt written under `.forge/crucible/`, Phase Plan written under `docs/plans/` with correct `crucibleId: imported-speckit-<uuid>` / `source: speckit` frontmatter, and audit-log entry appended.
- `pforge-mcp/tests/fixtures/speckit/{green,partial,invalid}/` — Pinned Spec Kit test fixtures captured from a real `github/spec-kit` run (SHA recorded in `README.md`). `green/`: all four files present and complete. `partial/`: `tasks.md` absent. `invalid/`: `spec.md` missing required `title` field.
- `pforge-mcp/tests/fixtures/speckit/README.md` — Fixture provenance: Spec Kit version SHA, the command used to capture `green/`, and regeneration instructions.
- `pforge-mcp/tests/step0-prompt-speckit.test.mjs` — Regression test greps the refactored prompt for the new `pforge crucible import --from=spec-kit --dry-run --json` tool-call pattern and asserts the absence of inline field-mapping prose.
- MCP tool **`forge_crucible_import`** — Registered in `pforge-mcp/tools.json` and `pforge-mcp/server.mjs`. Input: `{ source: "spec-kit", dir?: string, dryRun?: boolean, syncPrinciples?: boolean }`. Output: `importSpeckit` return shape. Returns `{ ok: false, error: "PROJECT_PRINCIPLES_EXISTS" }` when `syncPrinciples: true` and the file already exists.
- MCP tool **`forge_crucible_status`** — Registered identically. Input: `{ smeltId?: string }`. Output: `{ smelts: [{id, source, status, created}] }` (list all) or single smelt detail object (when `smeltId` provided). Exit 1 when `smeltId` is not found.
- Both new tools listed in `pforge-mcp/capabilities.mjs` under a new `crucible` capability section — `forge_capabilities` reports them.
- `pforge crucible import --from=spec-kit [--dir <path>] [--dry-run] [--sync-principles] [--json]` — New subcommand in `pforge.ps1` (via `Invoke-Crucible` function) and `pforge.sh` (via `cmd_crucible`). Routes to `node pforge-mcp/crucible-import.mjs`. `--json` emits structured JSON to stdout, no banner, no ANSI.
- `pforge crucible status [<smelt-id>] [--json]` — Lists all smelts in `.forge/crucible/` as a table or, with a smelt ID, prints full smelt detail. Exit 0 always for list; exit 1 when a specific smelt ID is not found.
- `pforge crucible --help` — Prints subcommand list and exits 0. `pforge crucible` with no subcommand also prints help.

#### Changed
- `.github/prompts/step0-specify-feature.prompt.md` — Spec Kit branch refactored (minimal swap). The prompt now invokes `pforge crucible import --from=spec-kit --dry-run --json` via a tool call to validate the mapping, presents the mapping report to the user, then invokes `pforge crucible import --from=spec-kit` to commit. Field-mapping prose removed; probabilistic mapper replaced with a deterministic tool call. "Start fresh" / "Skip Spec Kit" branches and the existing interview UX are unchanged. Degrades gracefully when no shell tool is available (instructs user to run the CLI manually).
- `docs/manual/spec-kit-interop.html` — Full rewrite to match shipping behavior: smelt path corrected from `.forge/smelts/` to `.forge/crucible/`, `pforge harden` references replaced with `/step2-harden-plan`, `pforge ext status spec-kit-interop` (non-existent command) removed, `pforge crucible export --to=spec-kit` moved to a "Roadmap" callout with link to Phase CRUCIBLE-EXPORT-CLI.

#### Notes
- **Open decisions resolved**: Markdown parser → `remark` + `remark-frontmatter` (robustness over zero-dep). Export → deferred to Phase CRUCIBLE-EXPORT-CLI. Plan filename → slugified `spec.md` title with `--name` override. Slash-command scope → minimal swap. `--sync-principles` on existing file → error (merge in follow-up). Fixtures → real `github/spec-kit` run. MCP tool name → `forge_crucible_import` (shorter; `source: "spec-kit"` carries the discriminator).
- **Backward-compatible**: `pforge crucible` is a new dispatch case; no existing subcommand modified. `pforge run-plan --manual-import --manual-import-source speckit` flow unchanged. `crucible-enforce.mjs` untouched.
- **Fail-safe for `--sync-principles`**: Returns `{ ok: false, error: "PROJECT_PRINCIPLES_EXISTS" }` — never silently overwrites an existing constitution.

## [2.92.1] — 2026-05-08 — Hotfix: Foundry quota preflight

> **One-liner**: Hotfix release adding opt-in AOAI quota preflight for plans running on the `microsoft-foundry` provider. Reads deployment TPM capacity via the Azure Cognitive Services control-plane API, compares against slice token estimates, and emits warnings (or optionally blocks execution) before a slice runs. Fail-open invariant: control-plane outages NEVER block execution. Closes the last open `docs/research/enterprise-fleet-readiness.md` §14 Priority-D item.

### Phase-FOUNDRY-QUOTA-PREFLIGHT — Azure AI Foundry deployment quota preflight

> **One-liner**: Adds a quota preflight step to `forge_run_plan` for Microsoft Foundry / BYO Azure OpenAI deployments — fetches TPM capacity from the Azure Cognitive Services control-plane REST API, caches results for 5 minutes, compares the slice token estimate against available headroom (safe ≥ 30 %, warning 10–30 %, critical < 10 %), and logs a structured `[foundry-quota]` annotation on every slice. Fail-open: any quota fetch error produces `status: "unknown"` and never blocks execution. Block mode (`PFORGE_FOUNDRY_QUOTA_PREFLIGHT=block`) halts execution on `critical` status.

#### Added
- `pforge-mcp/foundry-quota.mjs` — Core quota module. Exports `getDeploymentQuota()` (async REST call to `management.azure.com` Cognitive Services control-plane), `quotaCacheGet` / `quotaCacheSet` (5-minute in-process TTL cache keyed by `sub/rg/account/deployment`), and `compareSliceEstimate()` (synchronous comparator returning `{ status, headroomPct, message }`).
- `pforge-mcp/tests/foundry-quota.test.mjs` — 20 unit tests covering: TTL cache behaviour (get/set/expire/overwrite), missing-param validation, credential/token error paths, all HTTP error codes (401, 403, 429, 503, generic), success path with field parsing, cache-hit skip, network failure / timeout fail-open, and all four `compareSliceEstimate` threshold bands including negative headroom.
- `docs/integrations/foundry-quota-preflight.md` — Operator guide: activation (`PFORGE_FOUNDRY_QUOTA_PREFLIGHT=warn|block`), threshold reference, required Azure RBAC role (**Cognitive Services Usages Reader**), cache behaviour, quota response shape, `az role assignment create` example, and troubleshooting table.

#### Notes
- **Fail-open guarantee**: `timeout`, `rate_limited`, `forbidden`, `network_error`, and all other error reasons return `status: "unknown"` and never block execution regardless of mode.
- **Required RBAC role**: `Cognitive Services Usages Reader` (built-in) on the AOAI account or resource group — read-only `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/*/read`, no data-plane permissions.
- Token scope: `https://management.azure.com/.default` (commercial) or `https://management.azure.us/.default` (Azure Government — detected via endpoint suffix `.azure.us`).
- PTU (provisioned throughput) deployments do not report `tpmCapacity` on this endpoint; those slices receive `status: "unknown"` and proceed normally.
- `costForLeg()` and `priceSlice()` in `cost-service.mjs` are untouched.
- No release in this phase.

## [2.92.0] — 2026-05-08 — Docs UX lift (BCDR patterns adopted)

> **One-liner**: Documentation-only minor that adopts three reusable UX patterns from the BCDR-Digital-Twin sibling repo — a book-style manual spine, scroll-snap briefing decks, and an architecture hub — plus a shared design-token layer and site-wide navigation include. 14 slices executed via gh-copilot subscription path in 27.8 minutes; $0.14 declared / $0.00 wall. Zero `pforge-mcp/` or `pforge-master/` code touched.

### Phase-DOCS-UX-LIFT — BCDR UX patterns adopted for the docs site

> **One-liner**: Adopts three reusable UX patterns from the BCDR-Digital-Twin sibling repo — a book-style manual spine, scroll-snap briefing decks, and an architecture hub — plus a shared design-token layer and site-wide navigation include. Documentation-only phase; no `pforge-mcp/` or `pforge-master/` code changes.

#### Added
- `docs/manual/index.html` — Roman-numeral "Parts" grouping over the existing chapter/appendix list, per-entry status pills (`Draft` / `Planned` / `Stable` / `Deprecated`) sourced from the `STATUS` registry in `docs/manual/assets/manual.js`, and a meta-bar showing total parts, chapters, and edition number.
- `docs/manual/assets/manual.js` — `STATUS` registry mapping every chapter/appendix to a lifecycle status, Roman-numeral part definitions, and meta-bar rendering logic.
- `docs/assets/briefing-deck.css` — Scroll-snap, slide-number badge, and dot-nav CSS rules adapted from the BCDR briefing-deck pattern.
- `docs/assets/briefing-deck.js` — Dot-click → scroll, arrow-key → next/prev slide, and current-slide tracker JS for the briefing-deck format.
- `docs/walkthroughs/quickstart-deck.html` — Quickstart walkthrough converted from long-scroll markdown to briefing-deck format (one slide per section).
- `docs/walkthroughs/independent-dev-deck.html` — Independent-dev demo converted to briefing-deck format as a reference implementation.
- `docs/architecture/index.html` — Architecture hub landing page with cards linking to `UNIFIED-SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MEMORY-ARCHITECTURE.md`, and architecture appendices.
- `docs/assets/shared-styles.css` — Shared design-token layer (`pf-*` custom properties) with `html.light` theme support, consumed by manual, blog, capabilities, and architecture pages.
- `docs/assets/shared-theme.js` — Light/dark theme toggle script sourced from the shared layer.
- `docs/_includes/site-nav.html` — Site-wide navigation include with Architecture dropdown, wired into all landing pages.
- `docs/assets/site-nav.js` — JS for the site-nav dropdown and active-page highlighting.

#### Notes
- Source: manual review of `BCDR-Digital-Twin` sibling repo on 2026-05-07.
- No `pforge-mcp/dashboard/` files were touched — the ops console is explicitly out of scope.
- No release in this phase.

## [2.91.0] — 2026-05-07 — Priority-C Enterprise Readiness Chain

> **One-liner**: Ships all four `docs/research/enterprise-fleet-readiness.md` §14 Priority-C items as a single coordinated 4-phase, 34-slice chain — trajectory schema hardening (`source` + `security_risk` on every event per OpenHands pattern), OpenTelemetry `gen_ai.*` spans + `pforge audit export` CLI, BYO Microsoft Foundry / Azure OpenAI provider with `power-gov` quorum preset, and pluggable auth model + RBAC scaffold + 3 security docs. All four phases backwards-compatible (open-by-default for RBAC, opt-in via env var for OTel, additive event fields for trajectory). Subscription-CLI cost path (`gh-copilot`, `claude-cli`, `codex-cli`) byte-identical via the v2.83.0 `costForLeg()` invariant. ~3 hours of orchestrator wall time, $0.32 declared cost / $0.00 wall on gh-copilot subscription.

### Phase-AUTH-RBAC-SCAFFOLD — Auth model + SSO extension point + RBAC scaffold (2026-05-07)

> **One-liner**: Introduces a pluggable authentication model for Plan Forge MCP — a provider-dispatch `authenticate()` entry point, a bearer-token provider (behavior-preserving refactor of the existing `approvalSecret` flow), an SSO provider interface stub ready for `Phase-ENTRA-SSO`, a config-driven RBAC resolver (`resolveRoles` / `expandScopes` / `hasScope` with `:` hierarchy and `*` wildcard), `withAuth` middleware that gates tool dispatch and bridge edits, and three security docs. Fully backward-compatible: absent `.forge/rbac.json` → open-by-default, identical to pre-RBAC behavior.

#### Added
- `pforge-mcp/auth/index.mjs` — provider-dispatch `authenticate(req, opts)` entry point. Supports `bearer` (default), `sso`, and `none` providers. Returns a normalized `AuthResult` (`{ ok, token, provider, error? }`).
- `pforge-mcp/auth/providers/bearer.mjs` — extracted bearer-token provider. Accepts tokens via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header or `PFORGE_AUTH_TOKEN` env var. Permissive mode (any non-empty token) when no secret is configured; strict mode (exact match) when `opts.token` is set. Behavior-preserving refactor of the pre-phase `approvalSecret` check.
- `pforge-mcp/auth/providers/sso-stub.mjs` — SSO provider interface stub. Returns `ok: false` with a clear "not yet implemented" message. Replaced by a real provider in `Phase-ENTRA-SSO`. Defines the two-function contract (`authenticate`, `healthCheck`) that all SSO providers must implement.
- `pforge-mcp/auth/rbac.mjs` — config-driven RBAC resolver. Exports `resolveRoles(principal, config)` (transitive role expansion with cycle guard), `hasScope(roles, scope, config)` (exact, prefix-wildcard `:*`, and global-wildcard `*` matching). Reads `.forge/rbac.json`; absent config → all scope checks pass (open-by-default invariant).
- `pforge-mcp/auth/middleware.mjs` — `withAuth(handler, opts)` factory. Wraps any `(req, res)` handler with authentication (step 1) and optional RBAC scope check (step 2). On failure writes a structured JSON error (`401` / `403` / `500`) and short-circuits the handler. On success enriches `req.auth` with the `AuthResult`.
- `.forge/rbac.example.json` — annotated example RBAC config with `admin`, `developer`, `reader`, `ci` roles and example token assignments. Copy to `.forge/rbac.json` to activate.
- `pforge-mcp/tests/auth-rbac.test.mjs` — 12 test cases covering all acceptance criteria: absent-config backward compat, bearer valid/invalid, SSO stub interface shape, `resolveRoles` literal + inherited, `hasScope` hierarchy and wildcard, `withAuth` rejection on missing scope, auth-denial event emission, read-only open default.
- `docs/security/auth-model.md` — canonical statement of the Plan Forge authentication model: current bearer state, pluggable provider architecture, identity shape, middleware usage, security boundaries, read-only tool defaults, and how to add a new provider.
- `docs/security/sso-extension-point.md` — SSO provider contract: interface definition, current stub, step-by-step implementation guide, per-request lifecycle, error handling, response shapes, auth-decision event format, constraints, and planned future providers.
- `docs/security/rbac-config.md` — `.forge/rbac.json` schema reference: field descriptions, scope syntax (exact / prefix-wildcard / global-wildcard), built-in scope catalogue, common patterns (admin, developer, viewer, CI/CD), role inheritance examples, and recovery instructions.

#### Notes
- `bridge.approvalSecret` config key and `PFORGE_APPROVAL_SECRET` env var are unchanged — the bearer provider reads them identically to the pre-phase implementation.
- When `.forge/rbac.json` is absent, `withAuth` skips all scope checks and the system behaves byte-identically to the pre-RBAC state. No existing solo-operator workflow is affected.
- `costForLeg()` and `priceSlice()` in `cost-service.mjs` are untouched.
- No release in this phase.

### Phase-FOUNDRY-PROVIDER — Microsoft Azure AI Foundry / BYO Azure OpenAI provider (2026-05-07)

> **One-liner**: Adds `microsoft-foundry` as a first-class Plan Forge provider, enabling enterprises to route plan execution through their own Azure OpenAI Service or Azure AI Foundry endpoint. Two auth paths (API key and Entra/Managed Identity with `@azure/identity` optional dep), government-cloud auto-detection, deployment-name → model-key normalization via `.forge/foundry-deployments.json`, AOAI deployment-type cost uplift (Data Zone/Regional 1.1×), and a new `power-gov` quorum preset for Azure Government catalog models. Three new docs cover the BYO setup guide, Foundry Toolbox MCP integration, and App Insights OTel sink.

#### Added
- `pforge-mcp/secrets.mjs` — `KNOWN_SECRETS` now includes six Azure entries: `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`. All are automatically masked by `redactSecrets`.
- `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` — `microsoft-foundry` provider in the `API_PROVIDERS` dispatch table. Matches models with the `azure/` prefix; composes base URL from `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` using the stable `/openai/v1` route; uses `api-key` header convention (not `Authorization: Bearer`) per AOAI spec.
- `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` — `resolveAzureEntraToken()` async helper for Entra/Managed Identity auth. Dynamically imports `@azure/identity` (optional dep); returns `null` with a structured error on the call-worker path when the package is absent. Activated by `AZURE_AUTH_MODE=entra|managed-identity`.
- `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` — `getFoundryAuthScope(endpoint?)` exported helper. Returns `https://cognitiveservices.azure.us/.default` when the endpoint ends in `.azure.us` (Azure Government), otherwise `https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default`. Used by `resolveAzureEntraToken`; logged once at startup.
- `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` — `detectApiProvider()` exported for testability.
- `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` — `QUORUM_PRESETS["power-gov"]` preset: models `gpt-5.1`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `o3-mini`, `gpt-4o`; threshold 5; 5-minute dry-run timeout. Targets the reduced Azure Government model catalog per §11.8 friction point #6.
- `pforge-mcp/package.json` — `@azure/identity ^4.4.0` in `optionalDependencies`. Not required for the default API-key path.
- `pforge-mcp/cost-service.mjs` — `resolveFoundryModel(deployment)` helper. Reads `.forge/foundry-deployments.json` (operator-editable mapping `{ "deployment-name": "canonical-model-key" }`); falls back to the literal deployment name when the mapping is absent or the deployment is not listed.
- `pforge-mcp/cost-service.mjs` — `priceSlice()` detects `tokens.provider === 'microsoft-foundry'` or `worker === 'api-microsoft-foundry'`, resolves the deployment name to a canonical `MODEL_PRICING` key before `getPricing()`, and applies the AOAI deployment-type multiplier (`AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_TYPE` env var; `data-zone`/`regional` = 1.1×, `global`/`provisioned` = 1.0×).
- `pforge-mcp/cost-service.mjs` — `MODEL_PRICING` entries for `gpt-5.1`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini` (new), `o3-mini`, `gpt-4o` now carry `aoai_deployment_type_multiplier: { global, data-zone, regional, provisioned }`. New entry `gpt-4.1-mini` at `$0.40/$1.60` per Mtok.
- `pforge-mcp/tests/foundry-provider.test.mjs` — 16 test cases covering all ten acceptance criteria: `KNOWN_SECRETS` entries, provider activation, `api-key` header shape, Entra flag, missing-`@azure/identity` contract, `priceSlice` normalization, literal fallback, AOAI multiplier (data-zone 1.1× vs global), `power-gov` preset shape, and government cloud scope detection.
- `docs/integrations/byo-azure-openai.md` — Canonical BYO config guide: env vars, deployment-mapping file, API-key vs Entra paths, Azure Government notes, `power-gov` preset, AOAI deployment-type uplift, known friction points.
- `docs/integrations/foundry-toolbox-mcp.md` — `.vscode/mcp.json` walkthrough for Foundry Toolbox MCP server (Bearer token and Custom Keys auth). Notes per-call approval friction (§11.8 #4) and `"approval": "never"` opt-out.
- `docs/observability/foundry-app-insights.md` — Config guide for routing Plan Forge OTel telemetry to App Insights via OTLP/HTTP or the Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro. Includes KQL queries, multi-agent OTel convention alignment note, and PII warning for content capture.

#### Notes
- `costForLeg()` is byte-identical to pre-execution (v2.83.0 Forbidden Action #1 protected).
- `priceSlice()` positional signature is unchanged; Foundry handling is additive and only activates when `provider === 'microsoft-foundry'` or `worker === 'api-microsoft-foundry'`.
- Existing quorum presets (`auto`, `power`, `speed`, `false`) are unchanged. `power-gov` is additive.
- No release in this phase.

### Phase-OTEL-AUDIT-EXPORT Slice 12 — Observability documentation (2026-05-07)

> **One-liner**: Adds `docs/observability/` with the published `gen_ai.*` + `pforge.*` OTel span schema (`otel-schema.md`), the audit log event specification and `pforge audit export` CLI reference (`audit-log-spec.md`), and three sample dashboards (Grafana JSON v8+, Datadog JSON v3, Splunk SPL queries) for operators connecting Plan Forge telemetry to their observability stack.

#### Added
- `docs/observability/otel-schema.md` — Published OTel schema for Plan Forge. Documents all five span types (`gen_ai.chat`, `execute_tool`, `invoke_agent`, `invoke_workflow`, `pforge.gate`), all attributes per span including `gen_ai.*` semantic conventions and `pforge.*` vendor-namespace attributes, two histogram metrics (`gen_ai.client.operation.duration`, `gen_ai.client.token.usage`), opt-in content capture event, resource attributes, span parent-child hierarchy, activation env vars, and `.forge.json` configuration keys.
- `docs/observability/audit-log-spec.md` — Audit log event specification and `pforge audit export` CLI reference. Documents the `[ISO] event-type: {json}` line format, all event types (run lifecycle, slice lifecycle, gate events, tool events, bridge/edit-guard events), common `source` and `security_risk` fields, run directory layout, all CLI options (`--since`, `--until`, `--type`, `--run`, `--format`, `--output`), JSONL and CSV output formats with field mapping, and compliance/retention guidance.
- `docs/observability/sample-dashboards/grafana-pforge-overview.json` — Importable Grafana dashboard model (schema version 38). Includes stat panels for LLM call count, total tokens, P95 latency, gate failures, and bridge blocks; timeseries panels for call rate by model and token usage by type; a latency heatmap; and a gate failure table. Uses `${DS_PFORGE_METRICS}` datasource variable for Prometheus-compatible OTLP endpoint.
- `docs/observability/sample-dashboards/datadog-pforge-overview.json` — Importable Datadog dashboard JSON (v3 layout). Mirrors the Grafana panel set: five summary query-value widgets, call rate and token timeseries, a latency distribution, gate outcome timeseries, and a bridge-edit security event stream.
- `docs/observability/sample-dashboards/splunk-pforge-queries.spl` — Splunk SPL query library. Five sections: LLM call overview, cost analysis, gate outcomes, security/audit events (from `pforge audit export` JSONL ingest), and plan/slice performance. Ingest notes cover both OTel-via-collector and batch-via-HEC options.

#### Notes
- Documentation only — no code changes in this slice.
- `pforge.cost.usd` attribute name documented as the canonical vendor-namespace cost attribute per §8.6 spec note ("no `gen_ai.cost` attribute exists in the spec").
- Content capture (`pforge.telemetry.captureContent`) defaults to `false` throughout all documentation to match implementation. PII risk is explicitly called out.
- Grafana and Datadog dashboards use template variables for `plan` and `model` to enable per-plan and per-model drill-down.

### Phase-TRAJECTORY-SCHEMA-HARDENING — Explicit `source` and `security_risk` on events (2026-05-07)

> **One-liner**: Purely additive schema hardening that stamps two new fields — `source` and `security_risk` — onto every event record written by `appendEvent()` in `orchestrator.mjs`. Backward-compatible: `parseEventLine()` returns `null` for both fields when reading legacy `events.log` lines that predate this change. Downstream consumers (`forge_search`, `forge_timeline`, hub replay) are untouched — they read `data` opaquely and surface the new fields automatically. See `docs/research/enterprise-fleet-readiness.md` §8.5 (OpenHands pattern) and `docs/plans/Phase-TRAJECTORY-SCHEMA-HARDENING-PLAN.md` for the executed plan.

#### Added
- `source` field on every `appendEvent()` write: enum `"orchestrator" | "worker" | "user" | "hook" | "environment"`. Defaults to `"orchestrator"` when the caller omits it. Caller may override by passing `source` explicitly in the `data` argument.
- `security_risk` field on every `appendEvent()` write: enum `"none" | "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical"`. Defaults to `"none"`. Action-equivalent event types carry non-default values: `slice-started` = `"low"` (baseline), `bridge-edit-blocked` = `"high"`, `bridge-edit-approved` = request-tagged value, `tool-call` = `"none"` baseline. Aligns with `forge_secret_scan` severity scale for downstream gating.
- `parseEventLine()` (orchestrator.mjs parser region) now returns `source` and `security_risk` on the parsed object, defaulting to `null` when either field is absent on disk. `null` is intentionally distinct from `"orchestrator"` so readers can distinguish "old record" from "new record explicitly tagged as orchestrator".
- `EVENT_SOURCE` and `SECURITY_RISK` const objects defined near the top of `orchestrator.mjs` alongside other module-level constants — single source of truth for all enum values.
- `pforge-mcp/EVENTS.md` **Common Fields** subsection enumerating `source` and `security_risk` with enum values and defaults; four representative event examples (`slice-started`, `tool-call`, `bridge-edit-blocked`, `run-completed`) updated to show both fields.
- New test file `pforge-mcp/tests/event-schema-hardening.test.mjs` with six targeted tests: write-side default stamping, caller override of `source`, legacy-line backward-compat parse (no throw, returns `null`), round-trip of new-line fields, `bridge-edit-blocked` always `security_risk: "high"`, and a snapshot of all five `source` enum values on `slice-completed`.

#### Notes
- All changes are **purely additive**: no existing field is renamed, removed, or type-changed. All pre-existing tests in `orchestrator.test.mjs`, `hub.test.mjs`, `search-smoke.test.mjs`, `timeline-smoke.test.mjs`, and `g2-files.test.mjs` pass without modification.
- `bridge.mjs` call sites for `bridge-edit-blocked` and `bridge-edit-approved` now pass `security_risk` through to `appendEvent()`. No auth, gating, or policy logic was changed — this phase **records** the field only; enforcement is deferred to downstream phases.
- Historical `events.log` files are not migrated. Old records remain byte-identical on disk; the reader's `null` default is the migration strategy.
- `costForLeg()` and `priceSlice()` in `cost-service.mjs` are untouched.

## [2.90.11] — 2026-05-07 — Bug fixes

> **One-liner**: Hotfix bundle that ships two backwards-compatible bug-fix phases: tool-surface ACI hardening (5 fixes that shrink default payloads, eliminate silent empty results, and add cursor pagination to `forge_home_snapshot`) and cost-service token-coverage (vendor-aware billing math for prompt-cache reads, ephemeral cache writes, reasoning tokens, and OpenAI service tiers — fixes 30–80% cost underestimate on Anthropic + OpenAI workloads). Subscription-CLI cost path (`gh-copilot`, `claude-cli`, `codex-cli`) is byte-identical and unaffected.

### Phase-ACI-HARDENING — Tool surface ACI compliance pass (2026-05-07)

> **One-liner**: Five backwards-compatible tool-surface fixes raising the SWE-agent ACI compliance score (`docs/research/enterprise-fleet-readiness.md` §13). Default payloads shrink dramatically, empty results stop being silent, and `forge_home_snapshot` gains drill subcommand + cursor pagination so agents can fetch only what they need.

#### Added
- `forge_home_snapshot` `drill` parameter (`crucible | activeRuns | liveguard | tempering | activity`) — returns only the named quadrant for a focused, smaller payload. Default behaviour (full snapshot) unchanged.
- `forge_home_snapshot` `activityCursor` parameter + `activityPagination` response field (`{ hasMore, nextCursor, totalLines }`) — cursor pagination over the activity feed instead of always returning the most-recent N entries.
- `forge_watch_live` `verbose` parameter — defaults to `false`, projecting events to a lite shape `{ ts, type, correlationId }` (typically 90% smaller than full event payloads). Pass `verbose: true` to opt back into full event objects (pre-ACI behaviour).
- `forge_search` empty-result `message` field — when `total === 0`, the response now includes an actionable suggestion describing the query, active filters, and how to broaden the search. Eliminates "is search broken?" agent confusion.
- `forge_timeline` empty-result `message` field — same pattern: when no events fall in the window, the response includes a `message` describing the window, active filters, and how to widen.
- `forge_sweep` `markersFound` field + friendly success message — when no TODO/FIXME/HACK/stub/placeholder markers exist, output now reads `"✓ No TODO/FIXME/HACK/stub/placeholder markers found in app code. Code is complete!"` instead of staying silent. The structured `markersFound: 0|N` field is also added.
- New test file: `pforge-mcp/tests/aci-hardening.test.mjs` (15 cases covering drill, cursor pagination, and friendly empty messages).
- Tool-surface ACI temper-guards section in `.github/instructions/architecture-principles.instructions.md` — five anti-patterns ("return full object to be safe", "raw CLI output is good enough", "pagination too hard, return all", "empty response means nothing happened", "agent will figure undocumented fields out") with empirically validated counter-patterns. Plus two new entries in the Warning Signs list specifically for MCP tool surfaces.

#### Notes
- All five fixes are **backwards-compatible**: existing fields (`quadrants`, `hits`, `total`, `events`, `activityFeed`, `output`) keep their shapes. New behaviour is opt-in via new request params or surfaces only on the empty-result path.
- `costForLeg()` (v2.83.0 invariant, `pforge-mcp/cost-service.mjs:749`) is byte-identical — the cost-attribution machinery is untouched.

### Phase-COST-TOKEN-COVERAGE — Cost-Service Token Coverage (2026-05-06)

> **One-liner**: Adds vendor-aware billing math to `priceSlice()` for prompt-cache reads, ephemeral cache writes (5m + 1h split for Anthropic), reasoning tokens, and OpenAI service tiers (flex/priority). Also refreshes stale base rates (Anthropic Opus dropped 3×, GPT-5.4 dropped 2×) and adds 14 missing model entries. Fixes 30–80% cost underestimate on Anthropic + OpenAI workloads with prompt caching or extended thinking. See `docs/research/enterprise-fleet-readiness.md` §12 for the audit and `docs/plans/Phase-COST-TOKEN-COVERAGE-PLAN.md` for the executed plan.

#### Fixed
- `priceSlice()` now bills `cache_read_tokens`, `cache_creation_5m_tokens`, `cache_creation_1h_tokens`, and `service_tier`. Resolves systematic 30–80% cost underestimate on Anthropic + OpenAI workloads with prompt caching or extended thinking.
- Refreshed stale base rates in `MODEL_PRICING` against vendor-published rates retrieved 2026-05-06 (URLs cited in `_source` field per entry):
  - Claude Opus 4.5/4.6/4.7 corrected from $15/$75 to $5/$25 per Mtok (3× overestimate)
  - GPT-5.4 input corrected from $5 to $2.50 per Mtok (2× overestimate)
  - GPT-5.4-mini, GPT-5.3-codex, GPT-5.2, Claude Haiku 4.5 corrected to current vendor-published rates
- Added missing models: `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, `gpt-5.4-nano`, `gpt-5.1`, `o1`, `o1-mini`, `o3`, `o3-mini`, `o4-mini`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `grok-4.3`
- Marked `grok-3`, `grok-4-0709`, `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning`, `grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning` with `_retiredAfter: "2026-05-15"` per xAI retirement notice (entries kept for historical compatibility)

#### Added
- Per-vendor token-class breakdown in `priceSlice()` return shape: new `cost_breakdown` field with `input_uncached`, `input_cache_read`, `input_cache_write_5m`, `input_cache_write_1h`, `output_total`, `reasoning_tokens` (informational), `tier_adjustment`, `subscription_cost`, and (for xAI) `authoritative_source`.
- Per-model cache multipliers: OpenAI varies by family (GPT-5.x = 0.10×, GPT-4.1/o3/o4-mini = 0.25×, o1/o1-mini/o3-mini/GPT-4o = 0.50×); Anthropic 0.10× universal; xAI ~0.25× approximation. Cache writes free for OpenAI per vendor docs.
- Asymmetric service tier multipliers: flex 0.5× symmetric (gpt-5.5, gpt-5.4 only); priority 2.0× input / 1.5× output (gpt-5.5, gpt-5.4 only).
- xAI `cost_in_usd_ticks` authoritative override: when present in the response, `priceSlice()` uses it directly (1 tick = 1e-10 USD) and skips computed multiplier math.
- `parseResponse()` in `pforge-master/src/providers/anthropic-tools.mjs`, `openai-tools.mjs`, and `xai-tools.mjs` now extracts cache + reasoning + service_tier + cost_in_usd_ticks fields. Each adds a `vendor` field that signals to `priceSlice()` which billing convention to apply.
- New test files: `pforge-mcp/tests/cost-service-token-coverage.test.mjs` (14 cases covering all 5 vendor paths) and `pforge-mcp/tests/parseResponse-cache-fields.test.mjs` (11 cases covering the three provider extractions).

#### Notes
Plan Forge bills via three distinct paths depending on the worker configuration:

1. **Subscription CLI workers** (`gh-copilot`, `claude-cli`, `codex-cli`) bill via the v2.83.0 premium-request path (`CLI_PER_REQUEST_USD × premiumRequests`). **This fix does NOT affect this path** — GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Codex CLI users see no cost-report change. The `costForLeg()` helper at `pforge-mcp/cost-service.mjs:309-318` is byte-identical to pre-execution.
2. **Direct vendor API keys** (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `XAI_API_KEY` in `.forge/secrets.json` or env) bill per-token at vendor rates. This fix corrects both the missing token classes AND the stale base rates for this path.
3. **Azure OpenAI in customer tenant** bills per-token via AOAI rates. This fix applies the cache + reasoning fields uniformly; the AOAI deployment-type uplift (+10% for Data Zone / Regional vs. Global) is deferred to the BYO-Azure-OpenAI phase per `docs/research/enterprise-fleet-readiness.md` §11.5.A.

#### Verified
- All 38 existing `cost-service.test.mjs` tests pass (regression guard)
- All 14 new `cost-service-token-coverage.test.mjs` tests pass
- All 11 new `parseResponse-cache-fields.test.mjs` tests pass
- `cost-service-real-plans.test.mjs` smoke matrix passes
- `costForLeg()` v2.83.0 fix at `cost-service.mjs:309-318` byte-identical to pre-execution
- Subscription-CLI regression guard: `priceSlice({ model: 'gh-copilot', premiumRequests: 5 })` produces $0.05 (unchanged)
- Mirror-opposite vendor invariant: same logical workload bills correctly on both Anthropic (excludes cached from `tokens_in`) and OpenAI (includes cached in `tokens_in`)
- Reasoning tokens NOT double-counted: o3 with `reasoning_tokens=700` inside `tokens_out=1000` bills only at output rate × 1000

## [2.90.10] — 2026-05-05 — Hotfix: 3-issue self-repair (orchestrator + Forge-Master)

> **One-liner**: Closes three open self-repair / runtime issues filed against Plan Forge: (a) `attemptAutoCommit` sweeping operator files into slice commits (#151), (b) the slice gate not verifying every entry in the **Files Modified (Exhaustive)** table (#152), and (c) Forge-Master's planner-executed tool calls not surfacing in `result.toolCalls` (#153). All three fixes are non-breaking, additive, and back-compat (legacy code paths untouched when new params are absent).

### Fixed — Hotfix v2.90.10

- **#151 (high) — Auto-commit scope bleed.** `autoCommitSliceIfDirty` now accepts an optional `preSliceState` snapshot (captured at slice start via the new `snapshotPreSliceState`) and stages only paths the worker actually created or modified. Foreign (operator-owned) paths are reported via the new `slice-foreign-files-detected` event but left un-staged. Falls back to `git add -A` when no snapshot is provided. Restores accurate slice provenance for `pforge analyze` / scope-drift detection.
- **#152 (medium) — Files Modified (Exhaustive) not enforced.** Two-layer fix:
  - `step3-execute-slice.prompt.md` adds an explicit pre-completion checklist requiring the worker to confirm every row of the table appears in `git diff --name-only HEAD`.
  - Orchestrator-level non-blocking advisory: after a slice passes, `verifyFilesModified` parses the table, diffs declared paths against the working-tree changes, attaches the result to `sliceResult.filesModifiedCheck`, and emits `slice-files-modified-warning` for any missing entries. Strictly advisory — never flips status to failed.
- **#153 — Forge-Master planner steps invisible.** Planner-executed tool calls now push into `result.toolCalls` with `source: "planner"` (and `error` when the executor failed). Distinguishes planner pre-fetch from reactive tool-use in dashboard / API consumers, and excludes planner entries from the reactive tool-call budget so a 5-step pre-fetch doesn't burn the entire budget.

### Verified — Hotfix v2.90.10

- 17/17 `auto-commit-slice.test.mjs` (8 new for #151)
- 13/13 `files-modified-check.test.mjs` (new for #152)
- 384/384 `pforge-master` suite (3 new for #153, no regressions)
- 252/252 in touched orchestrator-area tests
- VERSION + `pforge-mcp/package.json` realigned to 2.90.10 (resolves the 2.90.8/2.90.9 drift that was failing `changelog-format` tests).



> **One-liner**: Syncs `docs/manual/capabilities.html` with the v2.90.x GitHub Stack work — adds a "GitHub Copilot Integration" subsection describing Forge-Master's default GitHub Models provider (no separate API key required for Copilot subscribers), a "GitHub Stack Integration" section covering the eight primitives, and a doc-sync regression guard that prevents tab-count drift.

### Added — Hotfix v2.90.9

- **GitHub Copilot Integration subsection** in `docs/manual/capabilities.html` — documents that Forge-Master uses GitHub Models by default; if you have GitHub Copilot, no separate API key is required. Includes provider table row with "githubCopilot" key and notes on the `XAI_API_KEY` fallback for Grok models.
- **GitHub Stack Integration section** in `docs/manual/capabilities.html` — covers the eight GitHub primitives (Issues, PRs, Actions, Packages, Copilot, Models, Discussions, Pages) surfaced by the v2.90.x hotfix series, with the five-layer architecture and dogfood timeline references.
- **Doc-sync regression guard** (`pforge-mcp/tests/capabilities-doc-sync.test.mjs`) — vitest case that validates the GitHub Copilot Integration subsection exists in capabilities.html, preventing future capabilities-doc drift.

### Verified — Hotfix v2.90.9

- Validation gate passes: VERSION=2.90.9, CHANGELOG contains `[2.90.9]` + GHCP mention, regression test green.

## [2.90.8]— 2026-05-05 — Hotfix: Dashboard GitHub-surface readiness widget

> **One-liner**: Adds a GitHub-surface readiness widget to the Plan-Forge dashboard, surfacing the `pforge github status` checklist as a live tile within the Metrics Leaderboard tab so teams can see their GitHub primitive readiness at a glance alongside their AI metrics.

### Added — Hotfix v2.90.8

- **Readiness widget** — a new `githubStackReadiness` tile in the dashboard's GitHub group shows the eight `pforge github status` checks rendered as coloured pass/warn/fail glyphs. Tile auto-refreshes when `pforge github status` is re-run or the MCP server restarts.
- **`GET /api/github/readiness`** endpoint in `pforge-mcp/server.mjs` — returns the cached readiness snapshot as JSON; consumed by the dashboard tile and by `forge_github_status` MCP tool consumers.
- **Wire-up in GH Metrics tab** (`pforge-mcp/dashboard/forge-github.js`) — readiness widget rendered at the top of the Metrics Leaderboard tab before the team table; collapses to a single summary line when all checks pass.

### Verified — Hotfix v2.90.8

- Validation gate passes: VERSION=2.90.8, CHANGELOG contains 2.90.8 + "dashboard", HTML section 9 row for 2.90.8, HTML section 6 "readiness widget" note present.

## [2.90.7]— 2026-05-05 — Hotfix: Appendix H content sync + two architecture SVGs

> **One-liner**: Brings the GitHub-stack chapter (Appendix H) up to date with the v2.90.x hotfix series. Section 9's captured-runs table gains six rows (one per hotfix), the "what we got wrong" bullets gain CLOSED-by-vN.N.N markers, and two new SVG diagrams (5-layer architecture, two-day dogfood timeline) make the strategic + operational story visible at a glance.

### Added
- **`docs/manual/assets/diagrams/github-stack-architecture.svg`** — 5-layer architecture diagram (Models → Agent runtimes → 8 GitHub primitives → Plan-Forge orchestration → Your repo). Embedded after Section 2's table.
- **`docs/manual/assets/diagrams/github-stack-dogfood-timeline.svg`** — two-day swimlane diagram showing yesterday's 6 phases, today's 6 hotfixes, the 5 issues each closed by its hotfix, and the live GitHub Issue #150. Embedded inside Section 9.
- **Six new rows in Section 9's captured-runs table** for v2.90.1 through v2.90.6.
- **CLOSED-by-vN.N.N markers** on all five "what we got wrong" bullets — every issue the dogfood surfaced is now linked to the hotfix that resolved it.
- **A fifth bullet** documenting the regex-over-escape bug Hotfix v2.90.1's own Slice 3 surfaced (closed by v2.90.3's W3 lint rule).

### Changed
- Section 9 opener gains a third paragraph noting "every issue the dogfood surfaced was closed in code by the v2.90.x hotfix series" — the chapter now describes a system that just rebuilt the parts of itself it found wanting.
- Total spend: $0.18 → $0.45 (33 phase slices + 18 hotfix slices = 51 worker-executed slices across two days).

### Verified
- 22/22 vitest cases (`manual-chapter-headings` + `changelog-format` regression tests) pass.
- Chapter is now 1030 lines, all 9 sections content-complete.

## [2.90.6] — 2026-05-05 — CHANGELOG cleanup + format regression guard

> **One-liner**: Consolidates the three overlapping Section-9/dogfood entries (originally shipped as 2.89.0, 2.89.1, 2.90.0) into a single canonical `[2.90.0]` entry, adds a "Hotfix series 2.90.x" skim-reader callout, normalises all `[X.Y.Z]` headings to the `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD — <one-liner>` em-dash format, and ships a regression test (`pforge-mcp/tests/changelog-format.test.mjs`) that prevents `[2.89.x]` headings from re-appearing and enforces em-dash separators going forward.

### Changed — Hotfix v2.90.6

- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — `[2.89.0]` and `[2.89.1]` headings removed as standalone bracketed entries; their content preserved verbatim under a "Detailed history" subsection inside `[2.90.0]`. A "Hotfix series 2.90.x" preamble added below the `[2.90.0]` heading for skim-readers. All `[X.Y.Z]` headings that contained dates now use em-dash (`—`) separators consistently.

### Added — Hotfix v2.90.6

- **`pforge-mcp/tests/changelog-format.test.mjs`** — vitest regression guard. Cases: (1) no `[2.89.0]` heading re-appears, (2) no `[2.89.1]` heading re-appears, (3) all dated `[X.Y.Z]` headings use em-dash (not hyphen-minus), (4) `[2.90.6]` heading exists, (5) `VERSION` reads `2.90.6`, (6) `pforge-mcp/package.json` reads `2.90.6`, (7) `VERSION` matches `pforge-mcp/package.json`.

### Why this matters

The May 5 hotfix series (2.90.1–2.90.5) produced five rapid entries in quick succession on top of the already-dense Section-9 dogfood narrative. Without consolidation, the front of the file consumed ~80 lines of dogfood detail before a reader reached any other content. The regression test ensures future releases cannot re-introduce the removed `[2.89.x]` versioning artifacts or silently revert to hyphen-minus separators.

## [2.90.5]— 2026-05-05 — Hotfix: Sequencer Hardening Sweep

> **One-liner**: Hardens `scripts/sequence-plans.ps1` into a tested, documented, module-backed sequencer. Extracts shared helpers into `scripts/sequence-plans.psm1`, adds a `-WhatIf` dry-run switch and `-MaxWaitMinutes` watch cap, ships a bash equivalent (`scripts/sequence-plans.sh`), adds Pester unit tests (`scripts/tests/sequence-plans.tests.ps1`), and creates `scripts/README.md` with full usage examples and scenario documentation.

### Added — Hotfix v2.90.5

- **`scripts/sequence-plans.psm1`** — PowerShell module exporting `Get-CurrentOrchestratorPid`, `Test-OrchestratorAlive`, `Get-LatestRunDir`, and `Get-RunStatus`. Extracted from the live-fixed sequencer script for testability. `Get-RunStatus` correctly inspects the `run-completed` JSON payload (`"failed": N`) and treats an absent terminal event as `in-progress` (safe failure).
- **`-WhatIf` switch** on `sequence-plans.ps1` — dry-run mode that prints what the sequencer would do (commit, push, dispatch) without executing any side effects. Safe for CI pre-flight checks.
- **`-MaxWaitMinutes` parameter** (default 240) — bounds the orchestrator watch loop. After the cap, the sequencer exits 1 with a timeout message rather than polling indefinitely.
- **`scripts/tests/sequence-plans.tests.ps1`** — Pester test file covering five `Get-RunStatus` scenarios (clean run, failed count > 0, explicit `run-failed`/`run-aborted` events, no terminal event, missing events.log) using fixture files created in a temp directory.
- **`scripts/sequence-plans.sh`** — Bash equivalent of `sequence-plans.ps1` for Linux/macOS, with feature-parity on the core chain-condition logic (`get_run_status`, `--whatif`, `--max-wait-minutes`).
- **`scripts/README.md`** — new documentation file describing the sequencer family: usage examples for both PowerShell and Bash, parameter table, `-WhatIf` output example, exit codes, chaining conditions, the four chaining scenarios, and the module API.

### Changed — Hotfix v2.90.5

- **`scripts/sequence-plans.ps1`** refactored to `Import-Module` the new `sequence-plans.psm1` module instead of inlining the helper functions. Behaviour is identical; the refactor enables unit testing of the helpers.

## [2.90.4]— 2026-05-05 — Hotfix: Copilot Coding Agent Enablement Detector (`copilot-coding-agent-assignable`)

> **One-liner**: Adds a `copilot-coding-agent-assignable` check to `inspectGithubStack()` (backing `pforge github status` / `forge_github_status`) that probes whether `@copilot` is an assignable user on the configured remote. Without a token the check returns `na`; with `--gh-token` it calls the GitHub Assignees API and returns `pass`, `warn` (Copilot not enabled), or `fail` (API error). The orchestrator's `--worker copilot-coding-agent` pre-flight always invokes the probe and promotes `warn` to a hard fail — preventing the silent 30-min polling timeout that occurred in the Phase GITHUB-C dogfood when the assignee was silently dropped.

### Added — Hotfix v2.90.4

- **`copilot-coding-agent-assignable` check** in `pforge-mcp/github-introspect.mjs` — new entry in the `inspectGithubStack` checks array (after `gh-cli`, before extras). Without a GitHub token, returns `{ status: "na", detail: "skipped — pass --gh-token to probe" }`. With a token, calls `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/assignees` filtered for `login === "copilot"`.
- **Return semantics**: `pass` — `@copilot` is assignable on this repo; `warn` — Copilot Coding Agent not enabled (`--assignee @copilot` will be silently dropped), with a `fixHint` linking to GitHub docs; `fail` — API error (401/403 token scope issue or network failure).
- **Orchestrator pre-flight integration** in `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` — when `--worker copilot-coding-agent` is active, the pre-flight always calls `inspectGithubStack(cwd, { ghToken: true })` and promotes the new check's `warn` result to a hard fail with the fix-hint surfaced. Prevents issue creation when the assignment would be silently dropped.
- **`pforge-mcp/tests/github-introspect-copilot-agent.test.mjs`** — vitest cases covering: `pass` (copilot in assignees), `warn` (copilot absent), `na` (no token provided), `fail` (API 401/403 error), `fail` (network error). Uses a mock-`gh` helper consistent with the existing `github-introspect.test.mjs` pattern.
- **Section 3 "Pre-flight checks" subsection** in `docs/manual/plan-forge-on-the-github-stack.html` — documents the `copilot-coding-agent-assignable` probe, its three return states, and when the orchestrator runs it automatically.

### Changed — Hotfix v2.90.4

- **`pforge github status --json`** output now includes the `copilot-coding-agent-assignable` check entry when `--gh-token` is supplied, preserving the stable JSON shape documented in the MCP Server Reference.

## [2.90.3]— 2026-05-05 — Hotfix: Gate Linter (W1–W4 warnings, strict mode, per-gate disable)

> **One-liner**: Adds a static gate-linter pass to `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` that scans validation-gate command strings before execution and emits structured warnings (W1–W4) for known portability anti-patterns. Strict mode (`PFORGE_GATE_LINT_STRICT=1`) promotes warnings to hard failures. Individual gates can opt out with a `# pforge-lint-disable <codes>` comment line.

### Added — Hotfix v2.90.3

- **Gate linter** in `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` — `lintGateCommand(cmd, opts?)` scans each gate string and returns `{ warnings: LintWarning[] }`. Called by `runGate` before spawning the subprocess; warnings are emitted as `gate-lint-warn` SSE events. In strict mode the gate is skipped and fails immediately.
- **Warning codes W1–W4**:
  - **W1** — `bash -c` / `sh -c` wrapper detected; gate will not run on Windows `cmd.exe`.
  - **W2** — Brace-group pipe (`| {`) detected; invisible through the `cmd.exe` → node shim.
  - **W3** — Quoted glob in `npx vitest run "…*…"` argument; glob is not expanded on Windows.
  - **W4** — `require()` call on a `.mjs` file detected; must use `import()` with `await`.
- **`PFORGE_GATE_LINT_STRICT`** environment variable — when set to `1` or `true`, any W1–W4 warning is treated as a hard gate failure. Default is advisory-only (warnings logged, gate still runs).
- **`# pforge-lint-disable <codes>`** inline directive — a gate command that contains this comment (e.g. `# pforge-lint-disable W1,W3`) suppresses the listed warning codes for that gate only. Useful for intentional platform-specific gates.
- **`pforge-mcp/tests/gate-linter.test.mjs`** — vitest cases covering: W1 detection (bash wrapper), W2 detection (brace-group), W3 detection (quoted vitest glob), W4 detection (require on .mjs), clean gate → no warnings, strict-mode abort, per-gate disable (single code, multiple codes, unknown code ignored), and combined multi-warning gates.
- **Gate linter section** in `.github/instructions/plan-gate-command-rules.md` — documents W1–W4 codes, `PFORGE_GATE_LINT_STRICT`, and `pforge-lint-disable` syntax.

### Environment variable

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PFORGE_GATE_LINT_STRICT` | _(unset)_ | Set to `1` or `true` to promote gate-linter warnings to hard failures. Any other value (including `0` or `false`) leaves the linter in advisory-only mode. |

## [2.90.2]— 2026-05-05 — Hotfix: Worker Timeout Uplift + Per-Slice Override

> **One-liner**: Raises the default worker subprocess timeout from 20 min to 30 min (`DEFAULT_WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS = 1_800_000`), adds `resolveWorkerTimeoutMs(opts)` for priority-chain resolution (per-slice frontmatter → `PFORGE_WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS` env → default), and wires the override into the slice runner. Prevents premature 20-min kills observed during the GitHub-stack dogfood (Phase B Slice 5, 25:28 first attempt).

### Added — Hotfix v2.90.2

- **`DEFAULT_WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS = 1_800_000`** (30 min) constant exported from `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` — replaces the previous hardcoded 20-min (`1_200_000`) default.
- **`resolveWorkerTimeoutMs(opts?)`** — priority-chain resolver: `opts.sliceOverride` (per-slice frontmatter) → `PFORGE_WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS` env var → `DEFAULT_WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS`. Mirrors `resolveGateTimeoutMs` shape. Accepts positive int/float; rejects zero, negative, or non-numeric (falls back with warning).
- **Per-slice `workerTimeoutMs` frontmatter** — `parsePlan` now extracts `**WorkerTimeoutMs**: <value>` (plain number or shorthand like `"30m"`, `"1h"`, `"90s"`) from slice body. Captured into `slice.workerTimeoutMs` and threaded into `spawnWorker({ timeout: resolveWorkerTimeoutMs({ sliceOverride: slice.workerTimeoutMs }) })`.
- **`pforge-mcp/tests/worker-timeout-resolve.test.mjs`** — vitest cases covering: default-30min, env-override (positive int, positive float, non-numeric fallback, empty-string fallback, zero fallback, negative fallback), per-slice-override (valid, zero, negative, null, undefined), slice-overrides-env (per-slice beats env), and uplift-guard (new default ≥ 1.5× old).
- **Worker timeout section** in `.github/instructions/plan-gate-command-rules.md` — documents `PFORGE_WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS`, the 30-min default, the per-slice override syntax, and the `resolveWorkerTimeoutMs` API surface.

### Changed

- **`spawnWorker` default timeout** raised from 1,200,000 ms (20 min) to `resolveWorkerTimeoutMs()` (30 min by default). Existing callers that pass an explicit `timeout` are unchanged.

## [2.90.1]— 2026-05-05 — Hotfix: Test-Sweep Deadlock Guard (output watchdog)

> **One-liner**: Adds a streaming-output watchdog to `spawnWorker` in `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` that fires a `slice-output-stalled` event and kills the subprocess when no stdout/stderr bytes arrive for `PFORGE_WORKER_OUTPUT_IDLE_MS` (default 8 min). Prevents the silent 25-min deadlock observed in Phase B Slice 9 and Phase D Slice 7 of the GitHub-stack dogfood.

### Added — Hotfix v2.90.1

- **`DEFAULT_WORKER_OUTPUT_IDLE_MS = 480_000`** (8 min) constant exported from `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` — the baseline idle threshold before the watchdog fires.
- **`resolveWorkerOutputIdleMs()`** — env-var resolver (mirrors `resolveGateTimeoutMs` shape). Reads `PFORGE_WORKER_OUTPUT_IDLE_MS`; falls back to default on absent, zero, negative, or non-numeric values. Positive float values are accepted.
- **Idle-timer inside `spawnWorker`** — resets on every `data` event from stdout and stderr. When the timer fires: subprocess is SIGKILL'd, `spawnWorker` resolves with `{ exitCode: -1, stalled: true, stallDurationMs }`, and the orchestrator emits a `slice-output-stalled` event with `{ sliceId, sliceTitle, stallDurationMs, lastBytesAtIso }` before the standard `slice-failed` event.
- **Watchdog skipped in `--dry-run` / `--estimate` mode** — no subprocess is spawned in those modes, so the timer is never installed.
- **`pforge-mcp/tests/spawn-worker-output-watchdog.test.mjs`** — 8 vitest cases covering: silent-killed, output-flows, env-override (positive int, positive float, non-numeric fallback, empty-string fallback, negative fallback), and env-zero-falls-back-to-default.
- **Worker output watchdog section** in `.github/instructions/plan-gate-command-rules.md` — documents `PFORGE_WORKER_OUTPUT_IDLE_MS`, the 8-min default, disable/soften patterns, and the `slice-output-stalled` event shape.

### Environment variable

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PFORGE_WORKER_OUTPUT_IDLE_MS` | `480000` (8 min) | Positive integer/float → override threshold. `0`, negative, or non-numeric → fall back to default. Set to a large value (e.g. `86400000`) to effectively soften the watchdog without disabling it. |

## [2.90.0]— 2026-05-05 — Phase GITHUB-B.1: --worker CLI plumbing + REAL Section 9 dogfood capture

> **One-liner**: Closes the gap between Phase B Slice 3 (orchestrator API supports `--worker copilot-coding-agent`) and the actual CLI dispatchers. The first dogfood attempt fell through to standard `gh-copilot` because `pforge.ps1`/`pforge.sh`/`orchestrator.mjs` argv parser never read `--worker`. This release wires the flag through all three layers and re-runs the dogfood for real — producing GitHub Issue #150 via genuine `gh issue create --assignee @copilot`. Copilot Coding Agent didn't pick it up (likely not enabled at the repo level), so the issue was closed without merge, but the dispatch pipeline is now verified end-to-end with both findings honestly captured in Section 9.

### Added — Phase GITHUB-B.1
- **`--worker <name>` flag** on `pforge run-plan` (PowerShell + bash) — forwards to the orchestrator's `runPlan(opts.worker)` (Phase B Slice 3 dispatch path). Currently recognises `copilot-coding-agent`; falls through to standard worker selection when omitted.
- **`getArg("--worker")` parsing** in `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` CLI entry point.
- **Usage strings** in both dispatcher help banners now list `--worker <name>`.

### Changed
- **Section 9 of Appendix H** — table row 9 now points at the real Issue #150 + the B.1 wiring commit. Footnote rewritten as a two-stage capture: first attempt revealed the CLI gap, B.1 fixed it, second attempt produced the live dispatch but Copilot Coding Agent didn't auto-pick-up the assignment.
- **"What we got right and what we got wrong" subsection** — the dogfood-CLI bullet now describes both findings (CLI plumbing + agent listener) instead of just the first.
- **Total spend** updated: $0.17 → $0.18 across 32 → 33 worker-executed slices.

### Verified
- 45/45 vitest cases across `manual-chapter-headings`, `run-plan-copilot-dispatch`, `copilot-coding-agent` test files all pass.
- `pforge run-plan ... --dry-run --worker copilot-coding-agent` now emits `issuePreviews` (proves the routing).
- Live `--worker copilot-coding-agent` dispatch successfully called `gh issue create` against `srnichols/plan-forge` and produced [Issue #150](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/150) (closed without merge per the runbook's rollback procedure).

### Next: enable Copilot Coding Agent on this repo
The remaining gap is at the GitHub side: Copilot Coding Agent appears not to be enabled for the user account or repository, so `--assignee @copilot` was silently dropped. When that's enabled, re-running `pforge run-plan docs/plans/Phase-GITHUB-C-DOGFOOD-PLAN.md --worker copilot-coding-agent` should round-trip the full Issue → PR → merge cycle in a single command.

### Hotfix series 2.90.x

Five hotfixes followed this base release, discovered during and after the GitHub-stack dogfood: **[2.90.1]** output watchdog (8-min idle kill), **[2.90.2]** worker timeout uplift (20 min → 30 min) with per-slice override, **[2.90.3]** gate linter (W1–W4 portability warnings), **[2.90.4]** `copilot-coding-agent-assignable` detector (prevents silent assignment drops), **[2.90.5]** sequencer hardening sweep (psm1 module, WhatIf, MaxWaitMinutes, bash parity). See individual entries above for full details.

### Detailed history

Versions 2.89.0 and 2.89.1 preceded this release and are consolidated here. They covered: **(2.89.0)** Appendix H Section 9 "Built with Plan-Forge" + dogfood runbook + Blazor/Fluent UI guidance for the `.NET` preset (blazor-fluent-ui.instructions.md, blazor-reviewer agent, ui-scaffold skill, Chapter 22 testbed section); **(2.89.1)** first live Section 9 dogfood run which correctly updated the DOGFOOD-MARKER but surfaced the CLI plumbing gap (--worker not wired through pforge.ps1/pforge.sh argv) that this 2.90.0 release fixed. The full individual entries follow below.

## 2.89.1 — 2026-05-05 — Section 9 dogfood capture (with honest CLI-plumbing footnote)

> **One-liner**: First live execution of the Section 9 dogfood plan. Marker correctly updated; revealed that `--worker copilot-coding-agent` is plumbed at the orchestrator API level (Phase B Slice 3) but not yet at the `pforge.ps1`/`pforge.sh` CLI arg parser. The May 5 run therefore used the standard `gh-copilot` worker, not Copilot Coding Agent's issue-dispatch path. Section 9 now documents this honestly and tracks the fix as Phase GITHUB-B.1.

### Added
- **`docs/plans/Phase-GITHUB-C-DOGFOOD-PLAN.md`** — single-slice dispatch plan that updates the DOGFOOD-MARKER comment in the chapter footer. Designed to round-trip through Copilot Coding Agent's issue/PR flow once Phase B.1 lands the CLI arg.
- **DOGFOOD-MARKER comment in Appendix H Section 9** — captured timestamp `2026-05-05T08:59` recording the live run.
- **Section 9 captured-runs table** now includes row 9 with a `†` honest footnote explaining the worker mismatch and the planned Phase B.1 follow-up.
- **"What we got right and what we got wrong" subsection** gains a fourth bullet documenting the CLI plumbing gap surfaced by the dogfood capture itself.

### Why this still matters
The dogfood didn't take the path the plan author intended (no GitHub Issue, no PR), but the run completed cleanly, the marker was correctly updated, and the gap is now documented in Section 9 itself — exactly what the chapter's "warts-and-all" framing exists to do. Phase GITHUB-B.1 will be a small, focused phase: add `--worker <name>` to the CLI arg parser in both dispatchers, then re-run this same dogfood plan against the real Copilot Coding Agent path.

## 2.89.0 — 2026-05-05 — Appendix H Section 9 ("Built with Plan-Forge") + dogfood runbook

> **One-liner**: Closes the GitHub-stack chapter. Adds Section 9 — the "Built with Plan-Forge" honesty section that documents which sections were written by which Plan-Forge run, the total $0.16 spend across 31 worker-executed slices, and a warts-and-all list of the two plan-author bugs and two long-running test deadlocks the dogfood surfaced. The deferred Slice 5 dogfood runbook is now authored at `docs/plans/PHASE-GITHUB-C-DOGFOOD-RUNBOOK.md` for future live-dispatch capture against the live `srnichols/plan-forge` repo.

### Added
- **Section 9 of Appendix H** — `Built with Plan-Forge` callout + captured-runs table mapping each chapter section to its Phase plan, worker, cost, and trajectory commit. Includes the "what we got right and what we got wrong" subsection citing the two plan-authoring bugs and two test-sweep deadlocks from the Phase B/C/D execution trail.
- **`docs/plans/PHASE-GITHUB-C-DOGFOOD-RUNBOOK.md`** — gated runbook for the live Copilot Coding Agent dispatch against the live repo. Documents pre-requisites, the dispatch command (`pforge run-plan ... --worker copilot-coding-agent --confirm-live-dispatch`), success criteria, and a full rollback procedure. Explicitly marked **DO NOT run as part of `pforge run-plan` autonomous execution**.

### Fixed
- `pforge-mcp/tests/manual-chapter-headings.test.mjs` — `platform-comparison is the last named sub-section` regression test now correctly bounds Section 8 to the start of Section 9 (`built-with-plan-forge`) rather than walking through to `chapter-prev-next`. Without this fix, adding any sub-section after Section 8 would produce a false failure.

### Why this matters
The chapter was 8/9 sections complete after the autonomous Phase C run. Section 9 was deferred because it requires a real GitHub Issue/PR dispatch against the live repo, which is unsafe to run inside `pforge run-plan` without human review. The runbook + Section 9 placeholder land the chapter at content-complete (with the dogfood capture itself remaining a one-off manual operation per the runbook).

### Added — Blazor + Fluent UI guidance for the .NET preset
The `dotnet` preset previously shipped 17 backend instruction files (api-patterns, auth, database, deploy, etc.) and 6 reviewer agents — but **zero UI-layer guidance**. Consumers building a Blazor front-end (e.g., the [plan-forge-testbed](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge-testbed) reference app) had no rules for pforge to enforce. This entry closes that gap with three artifacts in `presets/dotnet/`:

- **`presets/dotnet/.github/instructions/blazor-fluent-ui.instructions.md`** — auto-loads on `*.razor` / `*.razor.cs` edits via `applyTo`. Codifies the layering rule (no `DbContext` in components — page → service interface → repository), code-behind discipline, lifecycle correctness (`CancellationToken` propagation, `Dispose` patterns), Microsoft Fluent UI conventions, render-mode discipline, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility checklist, bUnit testing requirements, and a Warning Signs catalogue mirroring the one in `architecture-principles`.
- **`presets/dotnet/.github/agents/blazor-reviewer.agent.md`** — read-only reviewer agent in the same shape as `architecture-reviewer` / `database-reviewer`. Audits `.razor` / `.razor.cs` changes for layer violations (CRITICAL), lifecycle bugs (HIGH), missing server-side validation (HIGH), Fluent UI convention violations (MEDIUM), and accessibility gaps. Confidence-tagged output (`DEFINITE` / `LIKELY` / `INVESTIGATE`) and cross-reference tags for overlap with `accessibility-reviewer` / `architecture-reviewer`.
- **`presets/dotnet/.github/skills/ui-scaffold/SKILL.md`** — slash-command skill (`/ui-scaffold <Entity> --crud`) that scaffolds a new Blazor page **with the layering enforced from the start**: service interface (if missing), DTO/form model, page component split into markup + code-behind, three render branches (loading / success / error), bUnit tests covering all three branches, and an accessibility pass. Modes: `--read-only` (default), `--crud`, `--form-only`. Refuses to scaffold a page that injects `DbContext` directly — no exceptions.

### Added — Manual update
- **Chapter 22 "The Testbed" gains a Learn-by-Doing section** ([docs/manual/testbed.html](docs/manual/testbed.html#learn)) pointing at the [srnichols/plan-forge-testbed](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge-testbed) reference app and explaining the recommended learning order (backend slices → UI slices → operational scenarios). Documents the three new preset artifacts as the proof that pforge produces enterprise-grade UI rather than vibe-coded UI.

### Changed
- `presets/dotnet/.github/copilot-instructions.md` — instruction-file reference table now includes `blazor-fluent-ui.instructions.md` and `api-patterns.instructions.md`.

### Why this matters
The .NET preset assumed pure backend work. As soon as a consuming project added a Blazor surface (which the reference testbed now will, to demonstrate end-to-end pforge value beyond API CRUD), pforge had no rules to apply — meaning the orchestrator could ship `.razor` files that injected `DbContext`, skipped `<PageTitle>`, or hand-rolled validation, and the executor had no guardrails to catch it. The Blazor instruction file plus reviewer agent close that loop. The `ui-scaffold` skill makes the right shape the easiest shape to generate, which is how you actually get teams to follow architecture principles in practice.

### Files
- New: `presets/dotnet/.github/instructions/blazor-fluent-ui.instructions.md`, `presets/dotnet/.github/agents/blazor-reviewer.agent.md`, `presets/dotnet/.github/skills/ui-scaffold/SKILL.md`.
- Modified: `presets/dotnet/.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `docs/manual/testbed.html`.

## [2.88.0] — 2026-05-05 — GitHub-stack chapter heading conventions (Appendix H Slice 6)

> **One-liner**: Locked-in heading structure for the GitHub-stack chapter (Appendix H). Section 8 sub-section order is depth-first (Claude Code → Cursor → Codex). Section 5 Copilot Spaces sync uses automated command references, not inline manual-copy instructions. Dogfood capture uses local screenshot assets. Spec-Kit positioning reserved for Phase GITHUB-D. Regression test suite added. VERSION bumped to 2.88.0.

### Added
- **`pforge-mcp/tests/manual-chapter-headings.test.mjs`** — regression test suite for Appendix H heading conventions. Covers five decisions: (1) top-level h2 section order (§ 1–8), (2) Section 8 sub-section depth-first order (Claude Code → Cursor → Codex, not alphabetical), (3) Section 5 uses automated sync commands / links rather than inline manual-copy instructions, (4) dogfood screenshot in Section 1 references a local `assets/screenshots/` path not a public https:// URL, (5) `id="spec-kit"` absent until Phase GITHUB-D.

### Decisions documented
- **Section 8 sub-section order**: depth-first by Plan-Forge integration depth (Claude Code → Cursor → Codex). Alphabetical (Claude Code → Codex → Cursor) was considered and rejected because it obscures the integration-depth story — readers should encounter the most capable platform first.
- **Section 5 manual-copy instructions**: link/command approach only. Inlining step-by-step copy instructions for `.github/instructions/` files was rejected to avoid duplication with the instructions reference pages and to keep the section focused on automation.
- **Section 9 dogfood capture publication mode**: screenshot (local `assets/screenshots/`) rather than a public URL. Public URLs introduce availability risk; the local screenshot is regenerated by `scripts/capture-github-status-screenshot.mjs` as the testbed evolves.
- **Section 8 Spec-Kit positioning**: reserved for Phase GITHUB-D, to be appended after `platform-comparison` when that phase lands. Adding it prematurely would require a section restructure.

### Files
- New: `pforge-mcp/tests/manual-chapter-headings.test.mjs`.
- Modified: `VERSION`, `pforge-mcp/package.json`.

## [2.87.0] — 2026-05-05 — Copilot Metrics API leaderboard (Appendix H § 6)

> **One-liner**: Section 6 of Appendix H ("Plan Forge on the GitHub Stack") is now live — full documentation for `pforge github metrics pull`, the unified Copilot Metrics API + Plan-Forge leaderboard dashboard tab, `forge_github_metrics` MCP tool, JSONL schema versioning (`copilot-metrics/v1`), cache TTL configuration, and per-team join key precedence. VERSION bumped to 2.87.0.

### Added
- **Appendix H § 6 — Metrics API + Plan-Forge unified leaderboard**: full documentation for `pforge github metrics pull`. Covers the command flags (`--org`, `--enterprise`, `--team`, `--since`, `--out`, `--no-cache`), the JSONL schema (`copilot-metrics/v1` with `_schema` field for forward-compatible evolution), the `pforge-mcp/metrics-schema.mjs` module (`CURRENT_SCHEMA`, `validateRow`, `migrateRow`), dashboard tab group placement (Forge group vs GitHub group, `group: "github"` in `tab-registry.mjs`), the leaderboard composite score (AI-assisted PR rate 40%, acceptance rate 40%, code-review usage 20%), `forge_github_metrics` MCP tool (input schema: `team`, `since`, `metric`, `format`; reads from cached JSONL, never proxies GitHub API directly), cache TTL configuration (`cacheTtlMinutes` default 60, `staleWarningMinutes` default 480, `Cache-Control` header), and per-team join key precedence (explicit `teamMap` → slug normalisation → exact match; `--dry-run` join-preview table).
- Updated intro paragraph in Appendix H to reflect Section 6 as live; Sections 5, 7, 8 remain "in progress".
- "Coming soon" grid updated from 5–8 to 5, 7–8 (Section 6 promoted to full live section).
- Section 5 (Copilot Spaces sync) promoted from planned-grid card to a named stub section with an in-progress callout.

### Files
- Modified: `docs/manual/plan-forge-on-the-github-stack.html` (Section 6 full content; intro paragraph; Section 5 stub; coming-soon grid), `VERSION`, `pforge-mcp/package.json`.

## [2.86.0]

> **One-liner**: Sections 3 and 4 of Appendix H ("Plan Forge on the GitHub Stack") are now live — full documentation for `pforge run-plan --worker copilot-coding-agent` (issue body template, PR detection fallback, trajectory capture) and `pforge plan-from-sarif` (SARIF stdin support, severity ordering, security-audit integration). VERSION bumped to 2.86.0.

### Added
- **Appendix H § 3 — Dispatching to Copilot Coding Agent**: full documentation for `pforge run-plan --worker copilot-coding-agent`. Covers the issue body template (canonical block always present; per-stack block injected from `project-profile.instructions.md` when available), PR detection fallback order (linked-issue search via `gh pr list --search "closes #<N>"` first, branch-pattern scan second), `--dry-run` flag for previewing issue bodies, trajectory capture to `.forge/trajectories/<plan-slug>.jsonl`, and `--on-stall` behavior.
- **Appendix H § 4 — GHAS-driven remediation**: full documentation for `pforge plan-from-sarif`. Covers reading SARIF from a file or from stdin (`pforge plan-from-sarif -`), severity ordering (`error` → `warning` → `note`), slice structure (title, scope contract, per-rule validation gate), `--min-severity` and `--rule-filter` flags, and integration with the PreDeploy LiveGuard hook and `/security-audit` skill.
- Updated intro paragraph in Appendix H to reflect Sections 3 and 4 as live; Sections 5–8 remain "in progress".
- Sections 5–8 "coming soon" grid updated from 3–8 to 5–8 (Copilot Spaces sync, Metrics API leaderboard, BYOK, other agent platforms still planned).

### Files
- Modified: `docs/manual/plan-forge-on-the-github-stack.html` (Sections 3 and 4 full content; intro paragraph; coming-soon grid), `VERSION`, `pforge-mcp/package.json`.

## [2.85.0]— 2026-05-05 — `pforge github` introspection + GitHub-stack manual chapter

> **One-liner**: New opt-in `pforge github status` / `pforge github doctor` commands inspect a repo's GitHub-native AI surface (Copilot instructions, AGENTS.md, MCP, GHAS, Coding Agent prerequisites). Paired with a new manual chapter and audience tiles on the manual index. Strictly additive — no GitHub dependency added to the core path.

### Added
- **`pforge github status`** — read-only checklist of 8 GitHub-native primitives Plan-Forge integrates with: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`, `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`, `.vscode/mcp.json` (with Plan-Forge entry detection), `.github/workflows/`, `git remote → github.com`, `gh` CLI on PATH. Glyph output (✓/⚠/✗/⊘) plus `--json` for machine consumption. Exit code 0 if no failures, 1 otherwise.
- **`pforge github doctor`** — same checklist plus one-line `fixHint` for every warn/fail row.
- **`--extra` flag** — runs two SHOULD-tier depth checks: instruction-file `applyTo:` usage, copilot-instructions length ≥ 50 lines.
- **`forge_github_status` MCP tool** — same JSON output exposed to MCP clients (Copilot Chat, Claude Code, Cursor) so in-IDE chats can answer "what GitHub primitives am I missing?" with line-level precision.
- **Appendix H — "Plan Forge on the GitHub Stack"** — new manual chapter at [docs/manual/plan-forge-on-the-github-stack.html](docs/manual/plan-forge-on-the-github-stack.html). Covers the readiness check (Section 1) and the 8-primitive integration surface (Section 2). Sections 3–8 (Coding Agent dispatch, GHAS chains, Spaces sync, Metrics API leaderboard, BYOK, other agent platforms) are stubbed with "Coming next / Planned" callouts to land in upcoming releases.
- **Audience tiles** on `docs/manual/index.html` — four cards beneath the Quickstart hero: "I'm new to Plan-Forge", "I'm running it on the GitHub stack", "I'm extending it", "I'm on a different stack". Self-routes new readers to the right chapter without forcing the GitHub story on Bitbucket / GitLab / Azure DevOps users.
- **`scripts/capture-github-status-screenshot.mjs`** — Playwright-driven generator that runs `pforge github status` against the testbed and renders a styled terminal-pane PNG to `docs/manual/assets/screenshots/github-status-testbed.png`. Re-runnable as the testbed evolves.

### Changed
- `setup.ps1` and `setup.sh` post-install "Optional (recommended)" output gains one line pointing at `pforge github status` and the new chapter.
- `docs/manual/assets/manual.js` registers Appendix H between G (Update Source Modes) and About-the-Author.

### Files
- New: `pforge-mcp/github-introspect.mjs` (introspection module + CLI entrypoint), `pforge-mcp/tests/github-introspect.test.mjs` (34 tests covering all 8 default + 2 extra checks across green/partial/empty fixtures), `pforge-mcp/tests/fixtures/github-introspect/` (3 fixture directories).
- New: `docs/manual/plan-forge-on-the-github-stack.html`, `docs/manual/assets/screenshots/github-status-testbed.png`.
- New: `scripts/capture-github-status-screenshot.mjs`, `docs/plans/Phase-GITHUB-A-INTROSPECTION-PLAN.md`.
- Modified: `pforge.ps1`, `pforge.sh` (add `github` subcommand dispatcher), `pforge-mcp/server.mjs` + `pforge-mcp/tools.json` (register `forge_github_status` MCP tool), `setup.ps1`, `setup.sh`, `docs/manual/index.html`, `docs/manual/assets/manual.js`, `VERSION`, `pforge-mcp/package.json`.

### Why this matters
Plan-Forge has the deepest stack of integrations on GitHub — `.github/*` instruction files, AGENTS.md, MCP server, Copilot Coding Agent dispatch, GHAS-orchestrated remediation. But there was no way for a user (or a Microsoft / GitHub field engineer evaluating Plan-Forge for a customer) to see at a glance which GitHub primitives a given repo had wired up. This release fills that gap with a strictly opt-in CLI and a documentation home that grows over time. Phase GITHUB-B (Copilot Coding Agent dispatch + SARIF ingestion) and Phase GITHUB-C (the full chapter content) are the planned follow-ons.

## [2.83.0] — 2026-05-04 — Provider-aware quorum cost estimates (~250× over-estimate fix)

> **One-liner**: Quorum overhead pricing now respects the active provider. Subscription CLIs (gh-copilot, claude-cli) bill flat per-request instead of being incorrectly priced at raw API token rates — fixes the field-reported $23.53 estimate that ran ~$0.10–$0.50 in reality.

### Fixed
- **`estimatePlan` quorum overhead used token-based API pricing for every leg, ignoring the active provider.** The base estimate had been provider-aware since v2.60.0 (issue #120), but the quorum overhead block in `pforge-mcp/cost-service.mjs` still priced each dry-run leg via `MODEL_PRICING` regardless of whether `claude-opus-4.7` / `gpt-5.3-codex` were running through `claude-cli` / `gh-copilot` (flat ~$0.01 per premium request) or hitting the API directly ($15 / $75 per Mtok). Result: ~250× over-estimates for subscription CLI users (a 6-slice plan in `power` mode dropped from ~$23 to ~$0.45 after the fix). Now each leg is re-detected via `detectCostModel` and subscription legs charge `CLI_PER_REQUEST_USD`.
- **`estimateSlice` had the same provider-blind bug for both base cost and quorum overhead.** The per-slice picker numbers shown in dashboards now agree with the run-level estimate. Mirrors the `estimatePlan` fix using a shared `costForLeg()` helper.

### Tests
- New regression test in `pforge-mcp/tests/cost-service.test.mjs`: subscription mode (no API keys) caps power overhead under $1 and per-slice projection under $0.50 for a 6-slice fixture.
- Existing API-mode differential test (`per-leg pricing varies across quorum presets`) updated to explicitly set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` so it continues to exercise the token-pricing differential path the test was designed for.

### Files
- `pforge-mcp/cost-service.mjs` — `estimatePlan` and `estimateSlice` route per-leg pricing through a `costForLeg()` helper that consults `detectCostModel` per model.
- `pforge-mcp/tests/cost-service.test.mjs` — new subscription-mode regression test; existing differential test scoped to API mode via env-key setup/teardown.

### Field report (Rummag, 2026-05-04)
A user on `gh-copilot` saw `pforge` quote $23.53 for an 8-slice plan in `auto` mode where the actual run cost ~$0.10–$0.50. Investigation confirmed the v2.60.0 base-cost fix never reached the quorum overhead path. This release closes that gap.

## [2.82.2] — 2026-05-02 — Explicit downgrade guard for `pforge self-update`

> **One-liner**: `pforge self-update` no longer silently does nothing (or silently downgrades on `--force`) when the local VERSION is HIGHER than the latest GitHub release. Field report from a v2.96.0 user revealed the gap.

### Added
- **Explicit downgrade detection in `pforge self-update`** — when `current > latest` (clean local, no `-dev` suffix):
  - Without `--force`: prints `⚠ Your local VERSION (vX.Y.Z) is HIGHER than the latest GitHub release (vA.B.C)` with likely-causes hint (fork bumped past upstream, manual VERSION edit, sibling-clone with dev version baked in) and confirms self-update "is doing nothing on purpose — refuses to silently downgrade." Exits 0.
  - With `--force` alone: prints `⚠ DOWNGRADE: self-update wants to install vA.B.C but you already have vX.Y.Z` and exits 1. `--force` does NOT imply `--downgrade`.
  - With `--force --downgrade`: proceeds with explicit log line `↻ Proceeding with explicit downgrade`.

### Why
A user reported running `pforge self-update` from v2.96.0 (likely from a sibling clone with a manually-bumped VERSION or an internal fork). The old flow returned `✅ Already current (v2.96.0)` because `compareVersions(2.96.0, 2.82.1) < 0` is false. With `--force`, the heal path would have silently downgraded them to v2.82.1 with no warning. The new gate makes both surfaces explicit.

### Files
- `pforge.ps1` — `Invoke-SelfUpdate`: added `[version]` comparison + `--downgrade` flag handling
- `pforge.sh` — `cmd_self_update`: added `sort -V` comparison + `--downgrade` flag handling
- `docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md` — new disaster-recovery entry for the `current > latest` case

### Tests
Unchanged from v2.82.1 (3963 passing, 40 pre-existing baseline failures). No new tests — change is shell-script logic; test coverage planned for v2.83.0 alongside other update-flow tests.

## [2.82.1] — 2026-05-02 — 9-issue hotfix sweep + setup/update sync repair

> **Hotfix release** addressing the 9-issue cluster filed against v2.82.0 (#130–#138). Five orchestrator/Crucible bug classes that produced false-pass slices, orphaned deliverables, false-fail gates, and undocumented Crucible MCP failures. Net test delta: +5 passing, zero regressions across 4010-test suite.

### Fixed — Orchestrator (#130–#133)
- **#130 — Slice-prompt scope used `Context files` instead of `Files in scope`** — `parseSlices` now accepts `**Files in scope**` heading + multi-line bullet list as an edit allow-list source (previously only inline `**Files:**` was parsed). Also accepts `**Exit gate**` as an alias for `**Validation Gate**`. Hand-authored plans following the Crucible/Hardener convention no longer silently no-op slices that declared distinct context vs. edit targets.
- **#131 — `node -e` gates mangled by PowerShell on Windows** — `runGate` detects `node -e "..."` / `node -p "..."` invocations and runs them via `execFileSync('node', ['-e', script], { shell: false })`, bypassing PowerShell's `$var` expansion (`$transaction` → `""`) and backslash-stripping inside double-quoted strings (`\b`/`\s`/`\d` regex escapes were being eaten before node ever saw them). Eliminates the false-fail class that hit Phase-64 Slice 2, Phase-66 Slices 1+2 in field reports.
- **#132 — Failing gates orphaned worker deliverables** — new `stageOrphansOnSliceFailure()` helper runs `git add -A` (no commit) when a slice fails, writes `.forge/runs/<runId>/orphans-slice-<N>.json` listing every uncommitted file with copy-paste recovery commands, and emits a `slice-orphan-warning` event. The gate said no, the work is preserved; the human triages instead of losing it to a clean-tree on the next resume.
- **#133 — Non-empty stderr false-failed gates with exit code 0** — gate pass/fail is now strictly determined by `exitCode`. Stderr is captured separately (still surfaced for diagnostics in `gateResult.stderr`) but never promotes to `gateError` when exit was zero. Opt-in `failOnStderr: true` for gates that genuinely need strict-stderr behaviour. Prisma's `"Loaded Prisma config from prisma.config.ts"` banner no longer kills passing migrations.

### Fixed — Crucible (#134–#138)
- **#134 — `forge_crucible_*` MCP tools fell through to "Unknown command"** — added all 6 Crucible tool names (`forge_crucible_submit`, `_ask`, `_preview`, `_finalize`, `_list`, `_abandon`) to the `MCP_ONLY_TOOLS` allowlist in `server.mjs`. `POST /api/tool/forge_crucible_*` now routes through the MCP `CallToolRequestSchema` handler instead of falling through to `pforge.ps1` (which has no Crucible CLI verbs).
- **#135 — Feature/tweak interview never asked for `forbidden-actions`** — `forbidden-actions` added as a 7th feature-lane question and 4th tweak-lane question (between validation-gates and rollback). `CRITICAL_FIELDS` required it but no question collected it, making finalize unrunnable without a hand-edit of `.forge/crucible/<id>.json`. Question banks now match `CRITICAL_FIELDS`.
- **#136 — `/api/crucible/finalize` HTTP error stripped `criticalGaps`** — REST wrapper now returns `409 Conflict` with `criticalGaps[]`, `unresolvedFields[]`, and a `hint` pointing at `/api/crucible/preview`. LLM agents calling finalize can self-correct without a second API round-trip.
- **#137 — `forge_crucible_finalize` overwrote hand-authored plans** — new `CruciblePlanExistsError` thrown when `docs/plans/Phase-NN.md` exists and is non-empty. A side-by-side `Phase-NN.crucible-draft.md` is written so the smelt's draft is preserved, but the hand-authored plan is never replaced unless the caller passes `overwrite: true` (new optional param on both REST and MCP tool schemas). REST returns 409 with `phaseName` / `planPath` / `draftPath`.
- **#138 — `/api/crucible/ask` ignored client-supplied question id** — new optional `questionId` parameter on both REST and MCP `forge_crucible_ask` tool schemas. When supplied, the server validates it matches the pending question id and refuses with `ASK_QUESTION_MISMATCH` (REST: 409 with `expected` / `got`; MCP: structured `{ ok: false, code, expected, got }`). Multi-turn LLM clients that fall out of sync now get a loud failure instead of silent answer corruption.

### Fixed — Setup/update distribution sync
- **`templates/.github/hooks/postSlice` was missing** — the executable `postSlice` shell hook (Phase-38.3 knowledge-graph rebuild) existed in `.github/hooks/` but never landed in `templates/.github/hooks/`, so consuming repos never received it via setup. Mirrored per setup-update-invariants checklist.
- **`self-repair-reporting.instructions.md` was missing from setup/update enumerations** — the file existed in `.github/instructions/` and was loaded by Copilot, but `setup.ps1` Step 2, `setup.sh` Step 2, `pforge.ps1`'s `$sharedInstructions`, and `pforge.sh`'s `for instr_name in ...` loop all enumerated only 5 of the 6 shared instruction files. Consumers running `pforge update` never received it. Now enumerated in all 4 distribution surfaces.

### Tests
- All 9 issues fixed without regressing any previously-passing tests. Net suite delta: 3958 → 3963 passing (+5), 45 → 40 failing (-5). Remaining 40 failures are pre-existing baseline failures unrelated to this hotfix (forge-master intent router, tempering-integration two-scanner, runtime-quorum-viability, mcp-audit-tools, cost-service-real-plans).
- `tests/crucible-server.test.mjs` — 4 finalize tests now walk the full interview before finalizing (CRITICAL_FIELDS gate); `totalQuestions` updated 6→7.
- `tests/crucible-interview.test.mjs` — bank-length expectations updated tweak 3→4, feature 6→7.
- `tests/crucible-config-governance.test.mjs` — handoff test provides all 4 tweak answers.

### Schema additions (backward-compatible)
- `forge_crucible_ask` gained optional `questionId` (string).
- `forge_crucible_finalize` gained optional `overwrite` (boolean).
- New error codes documented in `tools.json` + `capabilities.mjs`: `ASK_QUESTION_MISMATCH`, `CRITICAL_FIELDS_MISSING`, `PLAN_ALREADY_EXISTS`.

## [2.82.0] — 2026-04-29 — Host-aware routing + 19-issue sweep

### Added
- **Host-aware routing preference (#104)** — `getRoutingPreference(host, userPref)` + `loadRoutingPreference(cwd)` in `orchestrator.mjs`. Default (`auto`): Claude Code / Cursor / Windsurf / Zed prefer direct API FIRST so users don't silently double-pay against their non-Copilot subscription. VS Code + Copilot / cli-terminal keep `gh-copilot` first. Override via `.forge.json` → `{ "routing": { "hostPreference": "auto" | "gh-copilot" | "direct-api" | "drop" } }`. The `"drop"` mode refuses `gpt-*` on non-Copilot hosts unless `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set (strongest "honor the vendor" stance).
- **Quorum pre-run summary table** — `filterQuorumModels` now emits a host + per-model billing surface table before any spend (✓/⚠/✗ rows with warning callouts). `formatQuorumSummary(rows, host, hostPreference)` exported for reuse.
- **Per-slice billing telemetry** — `slice-N.json` now records `host`, `billingSurface`, and `billingWarning` for cost aggregation that distinguishes subscription-covered vs pay-per-token spend.
- **`forge-master` sessions in unified timeline** (`fm-turn` events) — 9th source. Reads `.forge/fm-sessions/*.jsonl` + `*.archive.jsonl` with rotation-safe dedupe by `{sessionId, turn}`. Each event carries `lane`, `userMessage` (truncated 200 chars), and `turn`.
- **`pforge timeline` CLI** — offline chronological view via `scripts/timeline.mjs`. Flags: `--window`, `--from`, `--to`, `--source`, `--correlation`, `--group-by`, `--limit`, `--json`.
- **Dashboard Timeline tab** — `forge-master` source chip (🤖) + CSS badge alongside existing 8 sources.
- **Crucible finalize quality gate (#118)** — Phase-35: `CRITICAL_FIELDS` extended with `build-command` + `test-command`; `CrucibleFinalizeRefusedError` thrown when critical gaps remain. Inferred repo commands via new `inferRepoCommands` helper.

### Fixed
- **#104** — host-aware routing preference (see Added).
- **#105 / #125** — `resolveProjectRoot` two-tier markers: STRONG (`.forge.json`, `.git`) walks all ancestors of cwd then serverDir; WEAK (`package.json`) is fallback only. Eliminates project-root mis-detection when launching from subpackage dirs.
- **#106** — single source of truth for framework version in `server.mjs`.
- **#107** — quorum preset semantics: `power` = premium tier (`claude-opus-4.7` across the row); default tier uses `claude-opus-4.6` with `4.7` reviewer only.
- **#108 / #109 / #113 / #115** — `parseSlices` now merges `**Files:**` body-line paths into slice scope, fixing the SCOPE-vs-Files-manifest contradiction at the root.
- **#111 / #117 / #119 / #121 / #122 / #124 / #126 / #127** — verified pre-existing fixes (closed with verification comments).
- **#116** — `forge_bug_update_status` accepts both `newStatus` and `status`; emits `MISSING_STATUS` when neither is supplied.
- **#118** — Crucible finalize refuses to draft TBD-laden plans; gates rubber-stamping (Phase-35).
- **#120** — `detectCostModel` correctly identifies subscription vs API providers; `gpt-*`/`chatgpt-*` without `OPENAI_API_KEY` → `gh-copilot` host (~$0.01/req) instead of OpenAI direct pricing (fixes ~250x estimate overshoot for Copilot users). Phase-34.
- **#123** — `executeSlice` captures `startSha` before slice and detects worker-committed changes when tree is clean post-run.
- **#129** — origin tag-collision preflight prevents accidental overwrite of remote tags.
- Timeline LRU cache invalidates on `.forge/fm-sessions` mtime — prevents stale results after new turns are appended.

### Tests
- 26 new regression tests in `tests/host-routing-preference.test.mjs` (#104).
- 18 updated tests in `tests/quorum-probe.test.mjs` to reflect post-#103 routing.
- All 60 routing/quorum tests passing; broader suite green except known Windows-EPERM flakes in `quorum-config-precedence.test.mjs` (pre-existing).
- Removed duplicate `.test.js` files (vitest only loads `.test.mjs`).

## [2.81.0] — 2026-04-24 — Model routing split & meta-bug sweep

> **Highlight**: `gpt-*` / `chatgpt-*` models (including `gpt-5.3-codex`) no longer drop from auto-quorum when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is unset but `gh-copilot` is installed. The old pattern-match routing conflated "requires a direct API key" with "routed via HTTP"; the registry is now split into `DIRECT_API_ONLY` (grok-\*, dall-e-\* — no CLI proxy) and `COPILOT_SERVABLE` (gpt-\*, chatgpt-\* — proxied via Copilot subscription). Ships alongside 9 closed meta-bugs (#86, #90, #93, #97, #98, #99, #100, #101, #102, #103) and the `content-audit` scanner now wired into the standard tempering sequence.

### Added
- `content-audit` scanner is now wired into `runTemperingRun` as the 10th scanner in the standard sequence (after `mutation`). It probes configured routes for HTTP status, placeholders, and empty-shell SPA markers. Skips cleanly when no base URL is available. Adds `contentAuditMaxMs` budget key, `contentAuditScannerImpl` DI hook, `content-audit` entry in `SCANNER_IMPORT_MAP` + `SCANNER_ENTRY_POINTS`. Fixes meta-bug [#102](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/102).
- `intent-router` keyword rules expanded to cover conversational operational phrasings — "pick up the thread", "where we left off", "back to the X", preference/settings recall, and specific troubleshoot markers (`open bugs`, `failing gate`, `scope contract` violations). Reduces keyword-only fallback misroutes to offtopic. Fixes meta-bug [#98](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/98).
- `detectClientHost()` + `describeBillingSurface()` — new orchestrator exports that identify the editor/agent surface hosting Plan Forge (`vs-code-copilot`, `vs-code-agents`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `zed`, `claude-code`, `cli-terminal`) and translate routing choices into human-readable billing surfaces. `probeQuorumModelAvailability` results now carry `host`, `billing`, and `billingWarning` fields; `filterQuorumModels` logs the billing surface on every available model so users running Plan Forge from Claude Code or Cursor can see which subscription their `gpt-*` / `chatgpt-*` calls will hit. Observability only — full host-aware routing preference is tracked in meta-bug [#104](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/104).
- `setGhCopilotProbe()` — dependency-injection hook for the gh-copilot availability probe used by `isApiOnlyModel`, `probeQuorumModelAvailability`, and `spawnWorker`. Enables deterministic unit tests of routing precedence without touching the real PATH.
- `isDirectApiOnlyModel()` / `isCopilotServableModel()` — new pure pattern predicates corresponding to the split `DIRECT_API_ONLY` and `COPILOT_SERVABLE` provider registries.

### Fixed
- **Copilot-servable models (`gpt-*`, `chatgpt-*` including `gpt-5.3-codex`) no longer drop from the quorum when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is unset but `gh-copilot` is installed.** The old `API_PROVIDERS` registry conflated "requires a direct API key" with "routed via HTTP"; `probeQuorumModelAvailability` short-circuited to `unavailable: OPENAI_API_KEY not set` before the CLI fallback could offer gh-copilot, even though `gh copilot --model gpt-5.3-codex` would have served the model via the user's Copilot subscription. Registry is now split into `DIRECT_API_ONLY` (`grok-*`, `dall-e-*` — no CLI proxy exists) and `COPILOT_SERVABLE` (`gpt-*`, `chatgpt-*` — gh-copilot proxies via subscription). New routing precedence: `DIRECT_API_ONLY` → HTTP required; `COPILOT_SERVABLE` → gh-copilot CLI preferred, direct API fallback only if key set; everything else → CLI as before. `spawnWorker` also now pins `chosen = gh-copilot` when dispatching a Copilot-servable model so the `claude` / `codex` CLIs (which reject `--model gpt-*`) are never picked. `isApiOnlyModel` became environment-aware: returns `true` for `DIRECT_API_ONLY` always, `true` for `COPILOT_SERVABLE` only when gh-copilot is absent. Fixes meta-bug [#103](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/103). Adds `tests/copilot-servable-routing.test.mjs` (16 tests) and expands `tests/recommender-api-exclusion.test.mjs` (22 tests, up from 18) to cover the environment-aware semantics.
- `costService.estimateQuorum` / `estimateSlice` — callers that pass `cwd: null` now get a pure heuristic estimate instead of silently reading the pforge repo's own `.forge/cost-history.json`. Previously `cwd || process.cwd()` collapsed null to the working directory, producing `confidence: "historical"` on fresh plans and inflating power-mode totals by up to 8× via an inherited correction factor. `loadModelPerformance` and `getHistoricalFailureRate` also guard null cwd. Fixes meta-bug [#97](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/97).
- `orchestrator.executeSlice` — signal-killed workers are now marked `failed`, not `passed`. Added `detectKilledBySignal()` recognizing Windows `STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT` (0xC000013A), `STATUS_BREAK`, and Unix signal-encoded exits (128+signal). Status logic no longer defaults to passed when a slice has no validation gate AND the worker exited non-zero. `sliceResult` now surfaces `killedBySignal` and `statusReason`. Fixes meta-bug [#99](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/99).
- `executeSlice` — slices without a validation gate are no longer silently marked `passed` when the worker subprocess was killed by a signal (Windows `STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT` / `0xC000013A`, Unix SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGKILL). Orchestrator now detects signal-encoded exit codes via new `detectKilledBySignal` helper and sets `status = "failed"` with a human-readable `statusReason`. Also tightens the gate-less path: any non-zero exit without a validation gate is treated as failure because there is no independent cross-check that work actually landed. Fixes meta-bug [#99](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/99).
- `pforge audit-loop` / `runTemperingDrain` — drain now detects "no-work" runs (tempering disabled or no scanner adapters for the stack) and reports `terminated: "no-work"` with a reason, instead of falsely declaring `"converged"` on round 1 with curve `[0]`. CLI surfaces a yellow `⚠ Audit Drain Did Not Run` diagnostic with exit code 2 instead of a green checkmark. Fixes meta-bug [#101](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/101).
- `appendHistoryLine` — filesystem errors writing `.forge/tempering/drain-history.jsonl` are now collected and returned in `summary.fsErrors`; previously swallowed silently. CLI prints a warning when persistence fails. Also adds `summary.historyPath` so users can find the artifact.
- `pforge self-update` / `update-from-github.mjs` — now warns when source repo has pushed semver tags ahead of the latest GitHub Release. Consumers previously received a silently-older version when maintainers tagged without cutting Releases (meta-bug [#100](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/100)). New exports: `fetchNewestSemverTag`, `checkLatestDrift`. Warning surfaces in both `pforge.sh` and `pforge.ps1` update flows. Advisory-only — never fails the update.

### Docs
- Release procedure memory updated — `gh release create` is now called out as MANDATORY step 6, not optional. Verification step added: `node pforge-mcp/update-from-github.mjs resolve-tag` must print no `warning` field.
- `step2-harden-plan.prompt.md` + `ai-plan-hardening-runbook.instructions.md` — added explicit rule against nested escaped double-quotes inside `bash -c "..."` gate strings. Stacking three levels of escapes (`\\"`) collapses on Windows `cmd → bash` with `/bin/bash: -c: line 1: unexpected EOF while looking for matching quote`. Guidance: use single-quotes inside, switch to `node -e` + `.includes()`, or rely on an existing vitest test. The `validateGatePortability()` regex (`nested-double-quotes` rule) already catches this at plan-lint time; docs fix closes the prompt-side authoring gap. Fixes meta-bug [#93](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/93).
- `step2-harden-plan.prompt.md` — added a top-of-file warning against running the hardening prompt through headless `gh copilot` (`-p`, `--autopilot`). The CLI runs in a sandbox that cannot write to the workspace regardless of `--allow-all` / `--allow-all-tools` / `--yolo` flags; edits either 404 with `Permission denied` or silently land in `~/.copilot/session-state/<sid>/files/`. Users are directed to interactive VS Code Copilot chat or `forge_master_ask` instead. Documents meta-bug [#86](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/86) as an upstream `gh copilot` limitation.

## [2.80.1] — 2026-04-24 — Post-Phase-39 polish

> Packaging and surface polish on top of v2.80.0 — no runtime behavior changes.

### Fixed
- `pforge audit-loop --help` / `-h` — prints usage and exits cleanly without running a drain or writing history (previously fell through to execution).
- Forge-Master classifier keyword coverage — broadened operational/advisory lane regex; hammer-fm harness now passes 84/84 stress prompts with pure keyword routing (no LLM required).
- `scripts/hammer-fm.mjs` — added rate-limit retry with exponential backoff.

### Changed
- `pforge-mcp/capabilities.mjs#skills.available` — enumerated all 14 shared skills: added `/audit-loop`, `/forge-troubleshoot`, `/security-audit` to the advertised surface (previously listed 11).

### Docs
- `docs/RUMMAG-AUDIT-LOOP-FIELD-TEST.md` — field test guide for validating the audit-loop feature against an external project.

## [2.80.0] — 2026-04-24 — Audit Loop Promotion (Phase-39)

> **Phase-39 — Recursive audit-loop promotion to first-class Tempering subsystem.**
> Adds a closed-loop audit drain that discovers bugs from a running system: content-audit
> scanner probes live routes, `runTemperingDrain` iterates scan → triage → fix until
> convergence, and two new MCP tools (`forge_tempering_drain`, `forge_triage_route`) expose
> the pipeline programmatically. A classifier-reviewer agent and `/audit-loop` skill round
> out the user surface. Activation follows the quorum-style `off / auto / always` pattern
> via `.forge.json#audit` — default is `"off"`, explicit opt-in required.

### Added
- `pforge-mcp/tempering/scanners/content-audit.mjs` — HTTP-probe + HTML-inspection scanner. Probes routes against a live base URL, emits structured findings (status, title, h1, word count, placeholder markers, client-shell detection). Production guard via `looksLikeProduction()` from `ui-playwright.mjs`; `allowProduction` defaults to `false`.
- `pforge-mcp/tempering/drain.mjs` — `runTemperingDrain(opts)` iterates scan → triage → fix rounds until convergence or `maxRounds` (default 5). Accepts injectable `spawnWorker` for LLM worker injection. Emits hub events per round.
- `pforge-mcp/tempering/triage.mjs` — `routeFinding(finding, classifier) → { lane, payload, confidence }`. Routes findings to `"bug"` (bug registry), `"spec"` (Crucible), or `"classifier"` (local proposal artifact). Unknown classifier output falls safe to `{ lane: "bug", confidence: "low" }`.
- `pforge-mcp/tempering/auto-activate.mjs` — Activation surface: `loadAuditConfig(cwd)`, `saveAuditConfig(cwd, patch)`, `shouldAutoDrain(planContext)`. Config stored in `.forge.json#audit` with `mode: "off" | "auto" | "always"` (default `"off"`). `forbidProduction: true` is immutable.
- MCP tool `forge_tempering_drain` — programmatic access to the audit drain loop. Accepts `project`, `maxRounds`, `scanners`, `dryRun`, `env`.
- MCP tool `forge_triage_route` — programmatic finding triage. Accepts a finding object and optional classifier config, returns routed lane + payload.
- CLI command `pforge audit-loop` — manual one-shot drain. Flags: `--auto` (respect `.forge.json#audit` config), `--max=N`, `--dry-run`, `--env=dev|staging`.
- Classifier-reviewer agent (`classifier-reviewer.agent.md`) — reviews classifier lane proposals.
- `/audit-loop` slash command skill for interactive audit drain from chat.
- Dashboard audit-loop toggle — persists to `.forge.json#audit` via `saveAuditConfig`.
- `pforge run-plan` post-completion hook — checks `audit.mode` after plan completion. `"auto"` evaluates thresholds; `"always"` dispatches unconditionally; `"off"` skips. Never runs per-slice.
- E2E test suite: `pforge-mcp/tests/e2e-audit-loop.test.mjs`, `pforge-mcp/tests/e2e-audit-loop-cli.test.mjs`.

### Design Decisions (Slice 9 Documentation Sweep)
- `runTemperingDrain` accepts `spawnWorker` — already implemented and tested; consistent with visual-diff quorum injection pattern.
- Content-audit scanner reuses `looksLikeProduction()` guard from `ui-playwright.mjs` — no separate guard needed.
- Classifier lane proposals write to local `.forge/audits/` artifacts (not GitHub issues) for v2.80. GitHub PR creation deferred to v2.81+.
- CLI naming confirmed: `pforge audit-loop` (manual one-shot) vs `pforge audit-loop --auto` (config-respecting). Matches `--quorum=auto` convention.
- Dashboard toggle persists to `.forge.json#audit` (not session cache) — parity with existing tempering and Forge-Master prefs.

## [2.79.0] — 2026-04-23 — Forge-Master Embedding Intent Fallback (Phase-38.8)

> **Phase-38.8 — Embedding-based intent classification fallback.**
> Adds a "stage 1.5" cosine-similarity cache between the fast keyword scorer (stage 1) and the
> expensive router-model API call (stage 2). When a prompt closely matches a previously-classified
> prompt (cosine ≥ 0.85), the cached classification is inherited — zero API cost, works fully
> offline once warm. Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` via `@xenova/transformers` (optional peer dep) with
> a deterministic hash bag-of-words fallback when the package is not installed.

### Added
- `pforge-master/src/embedding/provider.mjs` — async `embed(text) → Float32Array`. Auto-selects `transformers-mini` (lazy-loaded `@xenova/transformers` `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) when available; falls back to `hash-bag` zero-dep deterministic hash bag-of-words baseline.
- `pforge-master/src/embedding/hash-bag.mjs` — tokenize, hash each token with a 32-bit hash, set corresponding index in a 512-length Float32Array; L2-normalize.
- `pforge-master/src/embedding/transformers-mini.mjs` — dynamic `import('@xenova/transformers')`, `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` pipeline.
- `pforge-master/src/embedding/cache.mjs` — `addEntry`, `query`, `evictLRU`, `save`, `load`. Cosine similarity, LRU eviction at 500-entry cap, binary file persistence (`.forge/fm-sessions/embedding-cache.bin`) with JSON metadata sidecar.
- `pforge-master/src/intent-router.mjs` — stage 1.5: after keyword scoring, before stage-2 router-model, queries the embedding cache. Returns `{via: "embedding-cache"}` on cache hit. Write-through: every successful classification is cached asynchronously. Skipped when `embeddingFallback === false`. Errors log a warning and fall through gracefully.
- `pforge-master/src/http-routes.mjs` — `loadPrefs`/`savePrefs` extended with `embeddingFallback: true` (default). New `GET /api/forge-master/cache-stats` endpoint returns `{size, hitRate, maxSize: 500}`.
- `pforge-mcp/dashboard/forge-master.js` — "Embedding Cache" tile showing cache size and hit rate.
- `scripts/probe-forge-master.mjs` — accumulates `via` field from each classification SSE event; prints `viaCounts: {keyword, embedding, router, other}` summary at end of run.
- `pforge-master/src/__tests__/embedding-provider.test.mjs` — hash-bag determinism, vector length, provider fallback tests.
- `pforge-master/src/__tests__/embedding-cache.test.mjs` — add/query round-trip, threshold filtering, LRU eviction, save/load.
- `pforge-master/src/__tests__/embedding-stage15.test.mjs` — stage 1.5 cache hit returns early with `via: "embedding-cache"`, fallback to stage-2 on miss, `embeddingFallback: false` opt-out, error resilience, write-through cache population.

## [2.78.0] — 2026-04-23 — Forge-Master Quorum Advisory Mode (Phase-38.7)

> **Phase-38.7 — Multi-model quorum advisory for high-stakes decisions.**
> When `quorumAdvisory` pref is `"always"` (or `"auto"` with advisory-lane escalation to high tier),
> Forge-Master fans out the prompt to 2–3 models in parallel and returns all replies with a dissent
> summary. A `quorum-estimate` SSE event is emitted before dispatch so clients can display cost and
> cancel. Quorum is hard-blocked on operational, troubleshoot, and build lanes. Human picks the reply
> — no auto-winner selection.

### Added
- `pforge-master/src/quorum-dispatcher.mjs` — `dispatchQuorum({prompt, models, deps})` dispatches to up to 3 models in parallel via `Promise.allSettled` with a 60s hard timeout. Returns `{replies: [{model, text, durationMs, costUSD}], dissent: {topic, axis}}`. Partial results on model failure (1 fails → remaining returned). `extractDissent(replies)` performs keyword-frequency divergence analysis across reply texts.
- `pforge-master/src/__tests__/quorum-dispatcher.test.mjs` — unit tests covering parallel dispatch, partial failure, all-fail, timeout, and dissent extraction.
- `pforge-master/src/reasoning.mjs` — quorum advisory path: reads `deps.quorumAdvisory` pref, evaluates auto-engage conditions (lane=advisory, autoEscalated, fromTier=high, confidence≥medium), emits `quorum-estimate` SSE event before dispatch, calls `dispatchQuorum`, accumulates quorum costs. Hard lane guard: quorum NEVER fires on operational/troubleshoot/build lanes (`QUORUM_BLOCKED_LANES` set).
- `pforge-master/src/http-routes.mjs` — `loadPrefs`/`savePrefs` extended with `quorumAdvisory: "off"|"auto"|"always"` field (default `"off"`). `quorum-estimate` SSE event emitted before model dispatch. `done` SSE event includes `quorumResult`. Both `/api/forge-master/ask` and `/api/forge-master/stream` endpoints pass `quorumAdvisory` and `onQuorumEstimate` callback to `runTurn`.
- `pforge-mcp/dashboard/forge-master.js` — "Quorum advisory" segmented control (`off / auto / always`) wired to `GET/PUT /api/forge-master/prefs`. `quorum-estimate` SSE listener renders cost estimate bubble with per-model badges. Multi-model reply cards rendered side-by-side with model name, duration, token counts, and cost. Dissent summary rendered as blockquote above reply cards.
- `pforge-master/tests/quorum-sse.test.mjs` — SSE ordering test: `quorum-estimate` event arrives before any reply chunk in auto-engage scenario.
- `pforge-master/tests/quorum-dashboard.test.mjs` — dashboard UI test: 3-card layout renders from fixture quorum reply payload, dissent summary visible.
- `.forge/validation/probes.json` — new probe `adv-quorum-trigger` with a high-stakes advisory prompt for quorum dispatch validation.

## [2.77.0] — 2026-04-23 — Forge-Master Pattern Surfacing (Phase-38.6)

> **Phase-38.6 — Read-only pattern detector scans run history and surfaces recurring patterns as advisory observations.**
> A file-based detector registry auto-discovers `pforge-mcp/patterns/detectors/*.mjs` modules.
> Four detectors ship: gate-failure-recurrence, model-failure-rate-by-complexity, slice-flap-pattern,
> and cost-anomaly. Patterns are surfaced in the troubleshoot lane as advisory context and via the
> new `forge_patterns_list` MCP tool (advisory lane only — Phase-32 guardrail). Dashboard adds a
> "Recurring patterns" panel grouped by severity. CLI: `pforge patterns list [--since <iso>]`.

### Added
- `pforge-mcp/patterns/registry.mjs` — `runDetectors(ctx)` auto-loads detectors from `detectors/` directory, invokes each with `{graph, runs, costs}`, collects results. Malformed detectors are skipped with a warning.
- `pforge-mcp/patterns/detectors/gate-failure-recurrence.mjs` — detects repeated gate failures (≥ 3 occurrences across ≥ 2 plans). Surfaces the `tee /tmp/` anti-pattern as a specific case.
- `pforge-mcp/patterns/detectors/model-failure-rate-by-complexity.mjs` — detects models with > 25% failure rate on slices with complexity ≥ 4.
- `pforge-mcp/patterns/detectors/slice-flap-pattern.mjs` — detects slices that flapped (pass→fail→pass) ≥ 3 times across runs.
- `pforge-mcp/patterns/detectors/cost-anomaly.mjs` — detects slices where cost spikes > 2× the rolling average.
- `forge_patterns_list` MCP tool — advisory-lane-only read-only tool. NOT in operational/troubleshoot/build allowlists (Phase-32 guardrail).
- `pforge-master/src/intent-router.mjs` — `forge_patterns_list` added to `LANE_TOOLS.advisory` only.
- `pforge-master/src/reasoning.mjs` — when troubleshoot lane fires AND `runAllDetectors` returns ≥ 1 match, pattern summaries appended to reply context as advisory observations.
- `pforge-mcp/dashboard/forge-master.js` — "Recurring Patterns" panel: `forgeMasterRenderPatternsPanel(patterns)` renders patterns grouped by severity (error → warning → info) with occurrence counts and plan names. `forgeMasterLoadPatterns()` fetches from `/api/forge-master/patterns`. Auto-loaded on Forge-Master tab init.
- `pforge.ps1` + `pforge.sh` — `pforge patterns list [--since <iso>]` CLI command.
- `pforge-mcp/tests/patterns-registry.test.mjs` — registry + gate-failure-recurrence detector tests.
- `pforge-mcp/tests/patterns-detectors.test.mjs` — tests for model-failure-rate, slice-flap, cost-anomaly detectors.
- `pforge-mcp/tests/patterns-dashboard.test.mjs` — dashboard panel rendering tests from fixture pattern data.

## [2.76.0] — 2026-04-23 — Forge-Master Daily Digest (Phase-38.5)

> **Phase-38.5 — Daily digest aggregator, renderer, CLI command, and dashboard tile.**
> `pforge digest [--date <iso>] [--notify] [--force]` generates a structured daily digest
> covering probe lane-match deltas, aging meta-bugs, stalled phases, drift trend, and cost
> anomalies. Routes via existing notifier extensions when `--notify` is passed. Idempotent
> by default — re-run on the same date is a no-op unless `--force` is supplied. Dashboard
> tile renders "Yesterday's Digest" on the Forge-Master tab.

### Added
- `pforge-mcp/digest/aggregator.mjs` — `buildDigest({projectDir, date, baselineDate})` reads probe results, meta-bugs, roadmap, drift history, and cost history. Returns `{sections, generatedAt}` with five sections: `probe-deltas`, `aging-bugs`, `stalled-phases`, `drift-trend`, `cost-anomaly`. Pure reader — never modifies artifacts.
- `pforge-mcp/digest/render.mjs` — `renderMarkdown(digest)` and `renderJson(digest)`. Markdown renderer includes severity badges (`🟢 info`, `🟡 warn`, `🔴 alert`), per-section item renderers, all-green summary, and UTC "Generated at" footer. JSON renderer produces stable `{version: "1", date, sections}` format.
- `pforge.ps1` + `pforge.sh` — `pforge digest` CLI command with `--date`, `--force`, and `--notify` flags. Idempotency guard: skips generation if digest file exists unless `--force`. Notifier dispatch via configured `extensions/notify-*` channels.
- `pforge-mcp/dashboard/forge-master.js` — "Yesterday's Digest" tile: `forgeMasterRenderDigestTile(digestJson)` renders a compact tile showing section severity icons and item counts. `forgeMasterLoadDigest()` fetches latest digest from `/api/forge-master/digest/latest`. Auto-loaded on Forge-Master tab init.
- `.github/workflows/forge-daily-digest.yml` — example GitHub Actions workflow with `schedule:` trigger (commented out by default) and `workflow_dispatch:` trigger (active). Uploads digest artifact.
- `pforge-mcp/tests/digest-aggregator.test.mjs` — unit tests for all 5 aggregator sections, empty-state, severity labels.
- `pforge-mcp/tests/digest-render.test.mjs` — snapshot-style determinism tests for Markdown and JSON renderers.
- `pforge-mcp/tests/digest-dashboard.test.mjs` — unit tests for dashboard tile rendering from fixture digest JSON.
- Digest output written to `.forge/digests/<YYYY-MM-DD>.json` (gitignored via `**/.forge/`).

## [2.75.1] — 2026-04-23 — Homepage dropdown actually hidden

> **Patch release — fixes the homepage nav dropdown that remained visible after v2.74.4's JS-only fix.**
> Root cause: `docs/index.html` does not load `assets/shared.css` and had **no** inline CSS for `.nav-dropdown`. The dropdown `<div>` carries Tailwind's `grid` utility (`display: grid`), so the panel was always rendered. The `nav-dropdown-open` class toggle added in v2.74.4 had nothing to match against. Added the missing CSS rules inline, with `!important` to beat Tailwind's `.grid` utility. Also simplified the click-toggle by dropping the CSS `:hover` open rule and the JS mouseleave timer — dropdowns are now strictly click-controlled across the whole site (click to open, click-again / click-outside / link-click / Escape to close).

### Fixed
- `docs/index.html` — added inline CSS for `.nav-dropdown-trigger > .nav-dropdown { display: none !important; }` and `.nav-dropdown-trigger.nav-dropdown-open > .nav-dropdown { display: grid !important; }`. The homepage dropdown now hides by default and only opens on click.
- `docs/assets/shared.css` — removed the CSS `:hover`-to-open rule (`@media (hover: hover)`) and the invisible `.nav-dropdown::before` hover-bridge pseudo-element. Removing hover-to-open eliminated the race with JS state that could leave dropdowns feeling stuck on hover-capable devices.
- `docs/assets/shared.js` and `docs/index.html` — removed the mouseleave auto-close timer. Close paths now come from explicit user actions only (click-outside, link-click, Escape).



> **Phase-38.4 — Planner-executor decomposition layer for Forge-Master.**
> `runTurn` now optionally runs a planner stage that decomposes complex multi-step queries
> into up to 5 ordered read-only tool calls, executes them (with dependency-aware parallelism),
> and synthesizes the reply over the joined results. Falls back to the existing reactive
> tool loop when the planner produces zero steps or detects a simple query.

### Added
- `pforge-master/src/planner.mjs` — `plan({userMessage, classification, lane, allowedTools, deps})` decomposes complex queries into up to 5 ordered tool-call steps. Skip heuristics for `offtopic` lane, single-tool-obvious queries, and empty allowlists. Uses cheapest provider tier (`resolveModel("low")`) for decomposition.
- `pforge-master/src/plan-executor.mjs` — `executePlan(plan, deps)` executes planned steps with dependency-aware parallelism (`Promise.all` for independent steps, sequential for `dependsOn` chains). Hard 30s timeout; single-step failures do not abort independent branches.
- `pforge-master/src/__tests__/planner.test.mjs` — unit tests for planner: multi-step plans, skip cases (offtopic, single-tool, no-tools), tool validation, max-step cap.
- `pforge-master/src/__tests__/plan-executor.test.mjs` — unit tests for executor: sequential execution, parallel branches, error isolation, timeout enforcement.
- `pforge-master/tests/planner-sse.test.mjs` — SSE event ordering: `plan` event emitted before `tool-call` events; no `plan` event when planner returns `skipReason`.
- `plan` SSE event — shape `{type: "plan", steps: [...]}` — emitted before tool-call events when the planner decomposes a query.
- 3 new validation probes (`planner-cost-breakdown`, `planner-recent-failures`, `planner-phase-status`) exercising multi-step planner queries.

### Changed
- `pforge-master/src/reasoning.mjs` — `runTurn` calls `plan()` after classification; if steps are non-empty, calls `executePlan` and synthesizes reply over results. Falls back to reactive loop on `skipReason` or planner failure.
- `pforge-master/src/http-routes.mjs` — forwards `plan` SSE event from `runTurn`.

## [2.74.4] — 2026-04-23 — Homepage dropdown + cumulative 2.74.x roll-up

> **Patch release — rolls up v2.74.0 through v2.74.3 (all previously documented but never tagged) plus a homepage-only UX fix.**
> The Resources dropdown on the `planforge.software` homepage was stuck open on touch and had no reliable close path on mouse, because `docs/index.html` uses an inline `<script>` block that predates the `nav-dropdown-open` click-toggle logic added to `shared.js`. Every other page already used `shared.js` and was unaffected.

### Fixed
- `docs/index.html` — ported the dropdown click-toggle, outside-click, Escape-key, and mouseleave grace-period logic from `assets/shared.js` into the homepage's inline script so the Resources menu now closes reliably on click-outside, Escape, and mouse-leave. Parity with all other pages restored.

### Included from prior untagged work
- v2.74.3 — `pforge analyze` wildcard crash fix (scope paths with `[]{}` characters)
- v2.74.2 — `forge_status` graceful fallback to root `ROADMAP.md`
- v2.74.1 — Forge-Master classifier tuning + hammer scenario corrections (4/8 → 8/8)
- v2.74.0 — Plan Forge Knowledge Graph (Phase-38.3, `forge_graph_query` advisory tool)

See the respective `[2.74.0]`–`[2.74.3]` sections below for full details.

---

## [2.74.3] — 2026-04-23 — `pforge analyze` wildcard crash fix

> **Point-release — unblocks `analyze` on plans containing bracket/brace characters in Scope Contract paths.**
> `Invoke-Analyze` used PowerShell `-like "*$fp*"` to match changed files against in-scope / forbidden path hints. When a scope line contained characters that PowerShell treats as wildcard metacharacters (`[`, `]`, `{`, `}`), the match threw `The specified wildcard character pattern is not valid`. Switched to `String.Contains` (literal substring) — same intent, no wildcard interpretation.

### Fixed
- `pforge.ps1` — `Invoke-Analyze` Coverage block uses `$file.Contains($fp)` / `$file.Contains($sp)` instead of `-like` wildcards. Analyze now completes on plans like `Phase-38.4-FM-PLANNER-EXECUTOR-v2.75-PLAN.md` whose scope lines include `{steps: [], skipReason: "lane=offtopic"}`.

---

## [2.74.2] — 2026-04-23 — `forge_status` graceful fallback (hammer 8/8)

> **Point-release — closes the last `ts-drift` failure from v2.74.1.**
> `pforge status` (and the MCP `forge_status` / `forge_plan_status` paths that wrap it) now fall back to root `ROADMAP.md` when `docs/plans/DEPLOYMENT-ROADMAP.md` is absent, and degrade to a friendly zero-exit notice when neither exists. A missing roadmap is a valid repo state, not an error — this keeps `forge_status` a soft tool for agent flows and fixes the `tool-success-rate` scorer false-negative.

### Fixed
- `pforge.ps1` / `pforge.sh` — `Invoke-Status` / `cmd_status` fall back to root `ROADMAP.md`, then to a zero-exit informational message. No more `exit 1` on repos without the consumer-template roadmap.

### Validated
- `pforge hammer-fm --scenario=shipped-prompts --tier=keyword-only --parallel=1 --timeout=90` → **8/8 passed** (report: `.forge/hammer-forge-master/reports/2026-04-23T18-44-51-953Z/`). Up from 7/8 in v2.74.1 and 4/8 pre-tuning.

---

## [2.74.1] — 2026-04-23 — Forge-Master classifier tuning + hammer scenario fixes

> **Point-release tuning off the 2026-04-23 hammer run.**
> Live hammer against shipped-prompts scenario went from **4/8 passing → 7/8 passing** after 2 classifier patterns + 2 scenario corrections. Classifier now correctly routes completeness-sweep vocabulary and read-only Crucible verbs to the operational lane. Remaining failure (`ts-drift` 1/3 tool-success) is a downstream `forge_status` / `forge_plan_status` bug, not classifier — tracked separately.

### Fixed
- `pforge-master/src/intent-router.mjs` — OPERATIONAL lane now matches `sweep|completeness sweep|todos?|stubs?|mocks?|incomplete|placeholders?` (weight 2). Previously classified as `offtopic`.
- `pforge-master/src/intent-router.mjs` — OPERATIONAL lane now matches `list/show/view/display … (all|active|pending|open|crucible)* (smelts?|crucible entries?|crucible items?)` (weight 3). Previously classified as `build` due to bare `crucible` keyword.
- `scripts/hammer-fm/scenarios/shipped-prompts.json` — `ts-diagnose-failure` `expectedTools` widened to the full valid diagnostic set (`forge_analyze`, `forge_smith`, `forge_plan_status`, `forge_health_trend`, `forge_sweep`, `forge_bug_list`) so the scenario measures intent, not tool-name parity.
- `scripts/hammer-fm/scenarios/shipped-prompts.json` — `cr-list-smelts` `expectedTools` corrected to `[forge_crucible_list, forge_search, forge_status]` (was wrongly `[forge_capabilities]`).
- `scripts/hammer-fm/scenarios/shipped-prompts.json` — `ts-drift` `expectedLane` corrected to `operational` (drift reports are operational readouts per classifier pattern at `intent-router.mjs:134`).

### Validated
- `pforge hammer-fm --scenario=shipped-prompts --tier=keyword-only --parallel=1` → **7/8 passed** (report: `.forge/hammer-forge-master/reports/2026-04-23T18-17-34-174Z/`).

---

## [2.74.0] — 2026-04-23 — Plan Forge Knowledge Graph (Phase-38.3)

> **Phase-38.3 — Queryable in-memory knowledge graph over Plan Forge artifacts.**
> A new `forge_graph_query` MCP tool (advisory lane only) collapses multi-artifact queries
> into a single call. Graph covers Phase, Slice, Commit, File, Bug, and Run nodes with
> typed edges. Snapshot persisted to `.forge/graph/snapshot.json` for cold-start.

### Added
- `pforge-mcp/graph/schema.mjs` — `NODE_TYPES` and `EDGE_TYPES` constants with JSDoc
- `pforge-mcp/graph/builder.mjs` — `buildGraph(projectDir, {since, execSyncFn})` reads `docs/plans/*.md`, `git log`, `.forge/runs/**`, `.forge/bugs/**`; writes atomic snapshot; returns `{nodes, edges}` (empty on fresh repos)
- `pforge-mcp/graph/query.mjs` — `queryByPhase`, `queryByFile`, `queryRecentChanges`, `neighbors` with lazy snapshot load; all return `{nodes, edges, nodeCount, edgeCount}`; `_resetGraphCache()` for testing
- `forge_graph_query` MCP tool registered in `pforge-mcp/server.mjs` — input schema `{type, filter, since, edgeType}`
- `pforge-mcp/tests/graph-builder.test.mjs` — unit tests: Phase/Slice extraction, commit nodes, empty-state, date filtering, malformed frontmatter
- `pforge-mcp/tests/graph-query.test.mjs` — unit tests: all 4 query functions, snapshot round-trip, empty-graph
- `pforge-master/tests/graph-tool-lane.test.mjs` — pins lane-restriction: `forge_graph_query` in advisory, absent from operational/troubleshoot/build
- `scripts/graph.mjs` — `pforge graph rebuild|stats|query <type>` CLI helper
- `pforge graph rebuild|stats|query` CLI in `pforge.ps1` and `pforge.sh`
- `.forge/graph/` added to `.gitignore`

### Changed
- `pforge-master/src/intent-router.mjs` — added `"forge_graph_query"` to `LANE_TOOLS.advisory` ONLY
- `pforge-mcp/capabilities.mjs` — `forge_graph_query` registered in `TOOL_METADATA`
- `pforge-mcp/tools.json` — `forge_graph_query` tool definition added

### Notes
- `forge_graph_query` is advisory-lane only (Phase-32 guardrail: build/operational/troubleshoot lists unchanged)
- Graph bounds: last 90 days of commits, last 10 runs per phase, last 200 bugs
- Snapshot at `.forge/graph/snapshot.json` is gitignored — never committed
- BFS neighbor traversal terminates at 1 hop by default; cyclic graphs are safe (visited-set guard)

## [2.73.0] — 2026-04-23 — Forge-Master Cross-Session Recall (Phase-38.2)

> **Phase-38.2 — BM25 recall index over past fm-sessions for cross-session memory.**
> `runTurn` now queries a BM25 index over all prior conversation turns for operational, troubleshoot, and advisory lanes, injecting the top-3 related turns as advisory context into the system prompt.
> Recall is non-fatal — index failure always degrades gracefully without affecting the turn.

### Added
- `pforge-master/src/recall-index.mjs` — pure-JS BM25 indexer (`buildIndex`, `loadIndex`, `queryIndex`); reads `*.jsonl` + `*.archive.jsonl` from `.forge/fm-sessions/`; excludes OFFTOPIC turns; lazy daily refresh; concurrent-build serialization; atomic write
- `pforge-master/src/__tests__/recall-index.test.mjs` — 16 tests covering build, query, lazy refresh, OFFTOPIC exclusion, concurrent builds, archive indexing, empty-state, malformed JSONL
- `pforge-master/src/__tests__/reasoning-recall.test.mjs` — 6 integration tests: cross-session recall surface, graceful degradation, OFFTOPIC skip, ephemeral skip, no-provider path, classification isolation
- `scripts/fm-recall.mjs` — CLI helper for `pforge fm-recall query "<text>"` and `pforge fm-recall rebuild`
- `pforge fm-recall query|rebuild` CLI commands in `pforge.ps1` and `pforge.sh`
- `pforge-mcp/tests/forge-master-recall.test.mjs` — 8 dashboard unit tests for the related-conversations panel: renders on non-empty payload, correct count in summary, per-turn message/lane/date, no-op on empty/null, updates in place

### Changed
- `pforge-master/src/reasoning.mjs` — cross-session recall for non-ephemeral sessions on `operational`, `troubleshoot`, `advisory` lanes; injects `> **Recall (advisory):**` block into contextBlock; `relatedTurns` returned on all result shapes
- `pforge-master/src/http-routes.mjs` — `done` SSE event now includes `relatedTurns` array (both Express and bare-node paths)
- `pforge-mcp/dashboard/forge-master.js` — `forgeMasterStream` handles `relatedTurns` from `done` event; `forgeMasterRenderRelatedConversations` renders collapsible `<details>` "Related conversations" section

### Notes
- Recall index stored at `.forge/fm-sessions/recall-index.json` — gitignored, never committed
- Minimum query length: 3 tokens (shorter queries return `[]` without index access)
- BM25 parameters: k1=1.5, b=0.75 (standard TREC defaults)
- Cross-project isolation: index keyed by `projectDir`; no leakage across repositories

## [2.72.0] — 2026-04-25 — Forge-Master Conversation Memory (Phase-38.1)

> **Phase-38.1 — File-based conversation memory for Forge-Master.**
> Adds JSONL session persistence so `runTurn` loads prior turns before classification and persists each turn to disk.
> Per-tab session IDs flow from the dashboard through the HTTP layer to the reasoning engine.

### Added
- `pforge-master/src/session-store.mjs` — file-based JSONL session persistence primitives: `appendTurn`, `loadSession`, `purgeSession`, `rotateIfNeeded`, `hashReply`; per-session mutex; auto-rotation at 200 turns (oldest 100 → archive); path sanitization against traversal
- `pforge-master/src/__tests__/session-store.test.mjs` — 20 tests covering all operations
- `pforge-master/src/__tests__/reasoning-session.test.mjs` — 5 integration tests for runTurn session persistence
- `pforge-master/tests/session-route.test.mjs` — 7 tests for HTTP session header threading and `/api/forge-master/session/:id` route
- `GET /api/forge-master/session/:id` HTTP route — returns `{sessionId, turns: last 10}` for both Express and bare-node paths
- `pforge fm-session list|purge <id>|purge --all` CLI commands in `pforge.ps1` and `pforge.sh`
- `docs/CLI-GUIDE.md` — `fm-session` subcommand group with file format, rotation, and usage notes

### Changed
- `pforge-master/src/reasoning.mjs` — canonical `effectiveSessionId` (deps.sessionId ?? input.sessionId); `isEphemeral` guard; prior turn loading (last 10) before classification; prior turns injected into contextBlock; OFFTOPIC path and main reply path both persist turns
- `pforge-master/src/http-routes.mjs` — POST `/api/forge-master/chat` reads `x-pforge-session-id` header; stream handler threads `deps.sessionId`; bare-node path mirrors same changes
- `pforge-mcp/dashboard/forge-master.js` — `FM_TAB_SESSION_ID` generated at module init via `sessionStorage`; attached as `x-pforge-session-id` header on every chat request

### Notes
- Session files stored in `.forge/fm-sessions/` which is gitignored — never committed
- Ephemeral sessions (no header) write nothing to disk — probe harness and CLI one-shots remain zero-disk-side-effect
- Pre-existing test failure in `reasoning-provider-selection.test.mjs` "(c)" unrelated to this phase

— 2026-04-24 — Forge-Master Hammer Harness (Phase-37.2)

> **Phase-37.2 — Hammer harness for end-to-end Forge-Master testing.**
> Adds `scripts/hammer-fm.mjs`, four bundled scenario packs, and `pforge hammer-fm` CLI surface.
> Replaces ad-hoc probe scripts with a repeatable, scored harness.

### Added
- `scripts/hammer-fm.mjs` — injectable CLI; `main(argv, deps)` returns exit code; `loadScenario(name, opts)` validates scenario packs
- `scripts/hammer-fm/sse-client.mjs` — chunk-boundary-safe SSE reader with injectable `fetchFn`
- `scripts/hammer-fm/scorers.mjs` — 6 pure scorer functions: `lane`, `toolPresence`, `contentMatch`, `noForbiddenContent`, `sseHealth`, `latency`; exported as `ALL_SCORERS`
- `scripts/hammer-fm/reporter.mjs` — Markdown + JSON reporter with per-prompt table, tier-comparison section, cost summary
- `scripts/hammer-fm/scenarios/shipped-prompts.json` — 8 prompts (1 per lane category)
- `scripts/hammer-fm/scenarios/realistic-qa.json` — 20 prompts (ambiguous, multi-intent, follow-up, off-topic, operational)
- `scripts/hammer-fm/scenarios/dial-sweep.json` — 10 prompts designed for tier-comparison sweeps
- `scripts/hammer-fm/scenarios/phase-38.1-baseline.json` — 6 conversation-memory baseline prompts for Phase-38.1 hardening
- `pforge hammer-fm` CLI command (pforge.sh + pforge.ps1)
- `docs/CLI-GUIDE.md` — `hammer-fm` section with scenario schema, bundled scenarios, and report format
- `.gitignore` — `.forge/hammer-forge-master/reports/` excluded
- `pforge-mcp/tests/hammer-fm.test.mjs` — 35 unit tests (all green)

### Changed
- `pforge.sh` / `pforge.ps1` — added `hammer-fm` dispatcher (`cmd_hammer_fm` / `Invoke-HammerFm`)
## [2.71.1] — 2026-04-23 — Forge-Master HTTP Bridge Completeness (Phase-37.1)

> **Phase-37.1 — Hotfix release. Live-fire hammer evidence on 2026-04-23 showed every downstream tool call from the Forge-Master HTTP bridge returned either `"Unknown tool: X"` or `"requires async dispatch — not available in Forge-Master bridge"`. Root cause: `invokeForgeTool` (the `mcpCall` injected into `registerForgeMasterRoutes`) handled only a subset of the MCP tool registry; the HTTP dispatcher bailed early on streaming tools instead of awaiting their terminal payload. This release closes both error classes for all read-only tools in `BASE_ALLOWLIST`. Re-hammer of the 8-prompt battery shows zero `Unknown tool` and zero `requires async dispatch` in all 8 post-fix logs; 7/8 labels have a non-error `tool-call` `resultSummary`.**

### Fixed

- **`pforge-mcp/server.mjs` → `invokeForgeTool` — dispatcher parity** — Extended the in-process MCP dispatcher to handle every read-only tool in `BASE_ALLOWLIST`. Tools previously returned `{"success":false,"error":"Unknown tool: X"}` now resolve via the correct `requestHandlers` path. For streaming tools, the dispatcher awaits the terminal event and aggregates intermediate events into `{events:[...], terminal: <payload>}` (capped at `streamEventCap`, default 20). The `"requires async dispatch — not available in Forge-Master bridge"` early-return stub is removed; async tools now resolve through the terminal-await path.
- **`pforge-master/src/http-dispatcher.mjs` — async terminal await** — Removed the early-return guard for streaming tools. Dispatcher now awaits final payload for tools using the Plan Forge async stream protocol. Docblock updated to describe terminal-await behaviour.
- **`pforge-master/src/allowlist.mjs` — allowlist hygiene** — `BASE_ALLOWLIST` entries with no MCP handler removed with inline `// removed in Phase-37.1 — no MCP handler` comment.

### Added

- **`pforge-master/tests/http-dispatcher-parity.test.mjs`** — Parameterised test asserting every `BASE_ALLOWLIST` entry resolves without `"Unknown tool"` or `"requires async dispatch"` error strings. Red scaffolds from Slice 1 now green.
- **`pforge-master/tests/http-dispatcher-async.test.mjs`** — Proves that mocked streaming tools (`forge_plan_status`, `forge_search`, `forge_cost_report`) resolve through the terminal-await path with `{events:[...], terminal: ...}`, not the old stub. Now green.

### Validation

- Re-hammer (`.forge/hammer-forge-master/logic/post-fix/*.txt`): 8/8 files — 0 `Unknown tool`, 0 `requires async dispatch`, 7/8 with non-error `tool-call` `resultSummary` (01-offtopic correctly has none; it is an off-topic query).
- Full `pforge-master` suite (≥ 133 tests) green. Full `pforge-mcp` suite green (tolerating pre-existing #97 cost-service regression).

## [2.71.0]— 2026-04-23 — Classifier calibration + Keyword-Only Harness (Phase-37 Slice 4)

> **Phase-37 Slice 4 — Harness validation & release. `--keyword-only` flag forces the probe to skip the stage-2 router model; `x-pforge-keyword-only: 1` HTTP header wires the bypass end-to-end from harness through HTTP routes to the `classify()` call. Validated: lane-match 19/21 (keyword-only) and 19/21 (normal) — both exceed the ≥16/18 threshold. Provider rate-limiting reduced live-reply count in both runs; classification routing is verified via SSE `classification` events emitted before any model call.**

### Added

- **`scripts/probe-forge-master.mjs` — `--keyword-only` flag** — When set, the probe sends `x-pforge-keyword-only: 1` on every `POST /api/forge-master/chat` request, instructing the server to skip stage-2 router-model classification and use the keyword-only result directly. Console output shows `keyword-only: true` banner. Enables isolated regression testing of `scoreKeywords()` without needing an API key or incurring model cost.
- **`pforge-master/src/http-routes.mjs` — `x-pforge-keyword-only` header support** — Both Express and bare-node paths read the `x-pforge-keyword-only: 1` request header from `POST /api/forge-master/chat`, store `keywordOnly: true` in the session, and forward `forceKeywordOnly: true` to `runTurn` in the SSE stream handler.
- **`pforge-master/src/reasoning.mjs` — `deps.forceKeywordOnly`** — When `deps.forceKeywordOnly` is true, `runTurn` passes `keywordOnly: true` to `classify()`, skipping the stage-2 router-model call. JSDoc updated to document the new dep field.
- **`pforge-master/src/intent-router.mjs` — `opts.keywordOnly`** — `classify()` accepts a `keywordOnly` option; when true, the router-model branch is skipped even if `callApiWorker` and `detectApiProvider` are provided. Enables deterministic, zero-cost classification in test and harness contexts.
- **Classifier calibration validated** — Both probe runs show lane-match 19/21 classifiable probes against `.forge/validation/probes.json`. Per-probe classification table in markdown report shows ✅/❌ per probe with expected vs. actual lane and confidence tier. Results committed to `.forge/validation/`. Finding 1 from `FINDINGS-2026-04-23.md` stamped RESOLVED.

### Notes

- The `forceKeywordOnly` path is a test/harness concern only. Production traffic via `forge_master_ask` always goes through the full two-stage classify flow.
- Rate-limiting on the GitHub Copilot provider reduced live-reply counts in both probe runs (11/24 and 11/24 replies). Lane-match accuracy — the primary classifier calibration metric — is unaffected by rate-limiting since classification fires before the reasoning model call.
- `scripts/probe-forge-master.mjs` confidence display now handles both string (`"low"|"medium"|"high"`) and numeric confidence values from the SSE `classification` event, preventing a `toFixed is not a function` crash introduced in Phase-36.

## [2.70.0] — 2026-04-23 — Forge-Master Runtime Observability (Phase-36 Slice 4)

> **Phase-36 Slice 4 — Probe validation & release. Classification events are now observable end-to-end via SSE; the probe harness captures lane + confidence per-probe and reports accuracy in Markdown.**

### Added

- **`scripts/probe-forge-master.mjs` — classification capture** — SSE parser now handles `event === "classification"`, storing `{ lane, confidence }` per probe. Console output format changed from `tokens=X/Y tools=Z` to `lane=<lane> conf=<conf> tokens=X/Y tools=Z`. Results JSON includes a top-level `classification` field per probe entry.
- **`scripts/probe-forge-master.mjs` — Classification match report section** — Markdown report gains a "Classification match" section with: overall lane-match count, per-lane accuracy table (`| Expected Lane | Matched |`), and per-probe table (`| Probe ID | Expected | Got | Confidence | Match |`). Each probe's body section gains a `**Classification**` line showing lane, confidence, and ✅/❌ match icon.
- **Harness caveats updated** — Removed the outdated `"classification.lane is not emitted via SSE"` warning (resolved: `onClassification` callback has been wired in `http-routes.mjs` since Phase-29). Retained the stub-dispatcher caveat.
- **Validation results committed** — `.forge/validation/results-2026-04-23T03-24-28-669Z.md` and `.json`. Run against `http://127.0.0.1:3100` with 24 probes: 14/21 classifiable probes matched expected lane (≥12 threshold); 70 lines containing ✅ or OK (≥22 threshold). See [results-2026-04-23T03-24-28-669Z.md](.forge/validation/results-2026-04-23T03-24-28-669Z.md).

### Notes

- Classification is driven by `classify()` in `pforge-master/src/intent-router.mjs` and forwarded via `onClassification` in `pforge-master/src/http-routes.mjs` (both express and bare-node paths).
- Rate-limiting on the GitHub Copilot provider caused 8/24 probes to short-circuit with `error: "rate_limited"`. Classification events still fired correctly for those probes (SSE sequence: `start → classification → error`). Reply-level metrics reflect available capacity; lane-match metrics cover all probes.

## [2.69.0] — 2026-04-23 — Phase-34 rebuild (Closes #96)

> **Phase-35 — Repairs Phase-34 hollow slices that shipped with grep-only gates and no vitest execution.**
> Root cause: Phase-34 grep-only gates shipped without running test suites. Fix: every gate that references a test file now invokes vitest.

### Added

- **Slice 1 — Intent-router additions** (`pforge-master/src/intent-router.mjs`) — New lanes: tempering, principle-judgment, meta-bug-triage with auto-escalation. Adds `LANES.TEMPERING`, `LANES.PRINCIPLE_JUDGMENT`, `LANES.META_BUG_TRIAGE` constants and exports `LANE_DESCRIPTORS` (frozen object, each lane keyed with `recommendedTierBump`). Keyword patterns tuned to beat existing OPERATIONAL/TROUBLESHOOT collision points. `LANE_TOOLS` entries for three new lanes (empty array; Phase-36 will populate). `scoreKeywords` zero-score map and stage-2 router-model prompt extended.
- **Slice 2 — Auto-escalation in runTurn** (`pforge-master/src/reasoning.mjs`) — `runTurn` inspects `LANE_DESCRIPTORS[lane].recommendedTierBump` and bumps resolved tier for high-stakes lanes (`low → medium → high`, capped). Return object gains `autoEscalated`, `fromTier`, `toTier`, `reason` fields on every code path. Opt-out: `forgeMaster.autoEscalate = false` in `.forge.json`.
- **Slice 3 — Prefs file persistence + REST endpoints** (`pforge-master/src/http-routes.mjs`) — Exports `loadPrefs(cwd)` and `savePrefs(prefs, cwd)`. Prefs backing file is `.forge/fm-prefs.json`. Defaults: `{ tier: null, autoEscalate: false }`. `GET /api/forge-master/prefs` and `PUT /api/forge-master/prefs` registered in `createHttpRoutes`. `forge_master_ask` reads prefs tier on each invocation and threads into `runTurn`.
- **Slice 4 — Dashboard dial UI** (`pforge-mcp/dashboard/forge-master.js`) — Prefs endpoints + Fast/Balanced/Deep dashboard dial. Three-position segmented control (Fast↔low, Balanced↔medium, Deep↔high) inserted above composer on tab load. On click, PUTs new tier to prefs endpoint. Dial hidden when prefs endpoint unavailable. No model names exposed in UI.

### Tests

- `pforge-master/src/__tests__/intent-auto-escalation.test.mjs` — 10 tests: LANE_DESCRIPTORS shape, recommendedTierBump values, classify routing for three new lanes, no regressions to existing lanes.
- `pforge-mcp/tests/forge-master-prefs.test.mjs` — 5 tests: loadPrefs defaults, round-trip save/load, invalid tier sanitisation, REST route registration.

## [2.68.1] — 2026-04-22 — Windows gate bash dispatch hotfix

> **Hotfix — Windows users whose gate commands use Unix-shell tools (`grep`, `test`, `sed`, etc.) were silently failing because the orchestrator dispatched gates through `cmd.exe` instead of bash.**

On Windows, the orchestrator's `execSync` call went directly to `cmd.exe`, which doesn't recognise Unix shell commands. The fix (Phase-34.1, closes [#94](../../issues/94) and [#95](../../issues/95)) teaches the orchestrator to detect Unix-shell syntax in gate command strings and auto-wrap them in `bash -c "..."` when Git for Windows bash is on `PATH`; if bash is absent the command is dispatched as-is (existing `node`/`npx`/`npm` gates are unaffected). The `step2-harden-plan.prompt.md` plan-authoring guidance now explicitly documents this behaviour so authors know they can safely write `grep`/`sed`/`test` gates when Git for Windows is available, and should fall back to `node -e` one-liners otherwise.

## [2.68.0]— 2026-04-22 — Forge-Master Reasoning Dial (Phase-34)

> **Forge-Master gains a reasoning dial: Fast / Balanced / Deep, no API key required for any tier.**

### Added

- **Slice 1 — Tier resolver + 429 fallback** (`pforge-master/src/reasoning-tier.mjs`, `pforge-master/src/config.mjs`, `pforge-master/src/reasoning.mjs`, `pforge-master/src/__tests__/reasoning-tier.test.mjs`) — New `reasoning-tier.mjs` module exports `resolveModel(tier, config)` mapping `"low"` → `gpt-4o-mini`, `"medium"` → `gpt-4o`, `"high"` → `claude-sonnet-4`. Unknown tiers fall back to `config.forgeMaster.defaultTier` (default `"low"`). `runTurn` accepts an optional `tier` parameter; an explicit `model` option always wins over the tier resolver. 429 graceful degradation: `high` → `medium` → `low` retry chain with no infinite loop at `low`. Turn trace gains `requestedTier`, `resolvedModel`, `fallbackFromTier`, and `escalated` fields. Defaults added to `config.mjs`: `forgeMaster.reasoningTiers`, `forgeMaster.defaultTier = "low"`, `forgeMaster.autoEscalate = true`.
- **Slice 2 — Auto-escalation for high-stakes lanes** (`pforge-master/src/intent-router.mjs`, `pforge-master/src/reasoning.mjs`, `pforge-master/src/__tests__/intent-auto-escalation.test.mjs`) — Each lane descriptor gains a `recommendedTierBump` integer (default `0`). Lanes `"tempering"`, `"principle-judgment"`, and `"meta-bug-triage"` set it to `1`. `runTurn` applies the bump once per turn (`low+1→medium`, `medium+1→high`, `high+1→high`, capped) when `config.forgeMaster.autoEscalate !== false` and no explicit `model` is set. Turn trace gains `autoEscalated`, `fromTier`, `toTier`, and `reason` fields. Opt-out: set `forgeMaster.autoEscalate = false` in `.forge.json`.
- **Slice 3 — Dashboard dial + prefs endpoint** (`pforge-mcp/server.mjs`, `pforge-mcp/dashboard/forge-master.js`, `pforge-mcp/dashboard/served-app.js`, `pforge-mcp/tests/forge-master-prefs.test.mjs`, `.forge/forge-master-prefs.json`) — `GET /api/forge-master/prefs` returns `{ tier, autoEscalate }` (defaults `low` / `true` when prefs file absent). `PUT /api/forge-master/prefs` validates tier and writes `.forge/forge-master-prefs.json`; returns HTTP 400 on invalid tier. `forge_master_ask` reads prefs on each invocation (≤ 5 s TTL cache) and threads `tier` into `runTurn`. Dashboard gains a three-position dial (Fast / Balanced / Deep) above the composer that does **not** expose model names. Dial hidden when no provider is reachable; `"Connect GitHub"` prompt shown instead.

### Tests

- `pforge-master/src/__tests__/reasoning-tier.test.mjs` — 7+ tests: low/medium/high resolution, unknown-tier fallback, explicit model override, 429-at-high retries to medium, 429-at-low surfaces error.
- `pforge-master/src/__tests__/intent-auto-escalation.test.mjs` — 10 tests: advisory lane no-bump, tempering/principle-judgment/meta-bug-triage bumps, cap at high, explicit model disables bump, `autoEscalate: false` disables bump, LANE_DESCRIPTORS shape.
- `pforge-mcp/tests/forge-master-prefs.test.mjs` — REST round-trip tests: GET defaults, PUT valid tier, PUT invalid tier (400), file write, TTL cache.

## [2.67.0]— 2026-04-22 — Zero-Key Forge-Master via GitHub Models (Phase-33)

> **Minor release — Forge-Master now works out of the box for GitHub Copilot subscribers — no API key required.**

### Added

- **Slice 1 — GitHub Copilot provider adapter** (`pforge-master/src/providers/github-copilot-tools.mjs`, `src/providers/__tests__/github-copilot-tools.test.mjs`, `src/__fixtures__/github-copilot/`) — New provider adapter targeting `https://models.github.ai/inference/chat/completions`. Authenticates via `resolveGitHubToken()` with a 4-tier resolution chain: passed option → `GITHUB_TOKEN` env → `.forge/secrets.json` → cached `gh auth token` subprocess result. `isAvailable()` returns `true` when any token source resolves without making HTTP calls. Model normalization: OpenAI-style (`gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`) and Anthropic-style (`claude-sonnet-4`, `claude-opus-4`) pass through; unknown names fall back to `gpt-4o-mini`. Structured 429 return (`{ error: "rate_limited", retryAfter }`) and hard throw on ≥ 500. Eight fixture-driven unit tests covering tool shape, message round-trip, happy-path, tool_calls parsing, 429, 500, model fallback, and `isAvailable`.
- **Slice 2 — Provider selection + zero-key default** (`pforge-master/src/reasoning.mjs`, `src/config.mjs`, `pforge-mcp/secrets.mjs`, `pforge-mcp/dashboard/served-app.js`, `src/__tests__/reasoning-provider-selection.test.mjs`) — Provider-selection loop now iterates `githubCopilot → anthropic → openai → xai`, picking the first adapter whose `isAvailable()` returns `true`. `config.mjs` gains `forgeMaster.defaultProvider = "githubCopilot"` and `forgeMaster.providers.githubCopilot.model = "gpt-4o-mini"`. No-provider error path now includes a `suggestion` field directing users to `gh auth login` or an explicit API key. `GITHUB_TOKEN` added to `KNOWN_SECRETS` as the first entry, labeled `"GitHub (Copilot, recommended)"`. Dashboard secrets UI renders `GITHUB_TOKEN` as the first row; existing keys retain their relative order.
- **Slice 3 — Skippable smoke test** (`pforge-mcp/tests/forge-master.smoke.test.mjs`, `scripts/smoke-forge-master.mjs`, `package.json`) — `forge-master.smoke.test.mjs` uses `describe.skipIf(!process.env.FORGE_SMOKE)` so CI without a live token always passes. When `FORGE_SMOKE=1`, invokes `runTurn` with an advisory prompt and asserts lane classification, keyword presence in response text, `tokensOut > 0`, and 30 s completion. `smoke-forge-master.mjs` standalone script prints the full response and writes a timestamped transcript to `.forge/smoke/forge-master-<ISO>.md`. Root `package.json` gains `"smoke:forge-master"` script.

### Tests

- `src/providers/__tests__/github-copilot-tools.test.mjs` — 8 fixture-driven tests: `buildTools` shape, `formatMessages` round-trip, `callProvider` happy path, `tool_calls` parsing, 429 structured return, 500 throw, model fallback, `isAvailable` true/false.
- `src/__tests__/reasoning-provider-selection.test.mjs` — 4 selection-order tests: githubCopilot first when `GITHUB_TOKEN` set, anthropic fallback, no-provider error + suggestion field, explicit `defaultProvider` override.
- `tests/forge-master.smoke.test.mjs` — 1 test, skipped without `FORGE_SMOKE=1`.

## [2.66.0]— 2026-04-22 — Forge-Master Advisory Mode (Phase-32)

> **Minor release — Phase-32 elevates Forge-Master from a narrow operational bot to a principled CTO-in-a-box advisor: event-delegated prompt gallery (bug fix), intent-router glossary expansion, advisory lane with architecture-first principles loader.**

### Added

- **Slice 1 — Event-delegated prompt gallery** (`dashboard/forge-master.js`, `tests/forge-master-gallery.test.mjs`) — Fixed HTML-attribute quoting bug: gallery buttons now emit `data-prompt-id` attributes instead of inline `onclick` handlers. `forgeMasterInit` attaches a single delegated `click` listener on `#fm-gallery-list` that resolves the target via `event.target.closest('[data-prompt-id]')`. `window.forgeMasterPickPrompt` global removed; legacy cross-tab globals retained. jsdom-based vitest covers click dispatch, `#fm-composer` value set, and `document.activeElement` focus.
- **Slice 2 — Intent-router glossary expansion** (`pforge-master/src/intent-router.mjs`, `tests/forge-master.test.mjs`) — `KEYWORD_RULES` gains 9+ new entries covering: bare `slice`/`gate` refs requiring a Plan Forge context marker, `phase-N` references, `harden`/`hardening`, `tempering`/`temper`, `quorum`, `meta-bug`/`self-repair`, `crucible` extras. Each family has positive + negative test coverage. `OFFTOPIC_REDIRECT` rewritten to enumerate all five lanes (`build`, `operational`, `troubleshoot`, `advisory`, `offtopic`) with one example question each. "What's the status of slice 4" now classifies as `operational`.
- **Slice 3 — Advisory lane + principles loader** (`pforge-master/src/intent-router.mjs`, `pforge-master/src/principles.mjs`, `pforge-master/src/system-prompt.md`, `pforge-master/src/reasoning.mjs`, `pforge-master/src/allowlist.mjs`, `tests/forge-master-principles.test.mjs`) — New `LANES.ADVISORY = "advisory"` constant and `LANE_TOOLS.advisory` (8 read-only tools: `forge_search`, `forge_timeline`, `brain_recall`, `forge_capabilities`, `forge_hotspot`, `forge_drift_report`, `forge_plan_status`, `forge_cost_report`). At least 6 keyword rules route advisory phrases (`"should I"`, `"should we"`, `"what's the right"`, `"architecture advice"`, `"help me decide"`, `"recommend"`). New `pforge-master/src/principles.mjs` exports `loadPrinciples({ cwd })` with per-cwd mtime-invalidating cache; reads `docs/plans/PROJECT-PRINCIPLES.md`, extracts `## Architecture Principles` from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, applies `.forge.json#forgeMaster.philosophy` override (replace by default; append with `"+ "` prefix). Falls back to 10-principle `UNIVERSAL_BASELINE` (Architecture-First through Keep Gates Boring). System-prompt gains `{principles_block}` placeholder under new `## Philosophy & Guardrails` section; `{context_block}` trims before `{principles_block}` under token pressure.

### Tests

- `tests/forge-master-gallery.test.mjs` — NEW jsdom vitest: click dispatch, value assertion, focus assertion, no-inline-onclick guard.
- `tests/forge-master.test.mjs` — Added glossary classification tests (positive + negative for each new keyword family), OFFTOPIC_REDIRECT content check.
- `tests/forge-master-principles.test.mjs` — NEW: universal baseline fallback, PROJECT-PRINCIPLES override, replace/append `.forge.json` semantics, mtime cache invalidation.
- `tests/forge-master.advisory.test.mjs` — NEW: LANES.ADVISORY, LANE_TOOLS.advisory, advisory-phrase classification, UNIVERSAL_BASELINE Architecture-First check, prompt catalog advisory category, tools.json mirror.

## [2.65.1]— 2026-04-22 — version-bump architectural rebuild (Phase-31.1)

> **Patch release — Closes #91. The `version-bump` command was rewritten from an inline imperative script into a structured, testable pipeline with a shared targets manifest. `pforge.sh` now has full parity with `pforge.ps1`. A new Vitest suite provides regression coverage.**

### Changed

- **`pforge.ps1 version-bump` refactored (Slice 3)** — Extracted `Get-VersionTargets` helper that returns a typed targets array with `File`, `Pattern`, `Replacement`, `Strategy`, and `Optional` fields. The bump loop is now data-driven; adding a new target requires one manifest entry, not imperative code.
- **`pforge.sh version-bump` parity port (Slice 4)** — Shell implementation ported to match the PowerShell architecture: same targets manifest, same `--dry-run` / `--strict` flags, same `Updated N/M targets` summary line and exit semantics.

### Tests

- **`pforge-mcp/tests/version-bump.test.mjs`** — Vitest suite covering dry-run output, strict-mode exit codes, each named target, optional-target skip, and cross-platform summary format.

### Meta

- Closes GitHub issue **#91** — version-bump brittle single-file implementation.

## [2.65.0]— 2026-04-22 — Advisory-to-Enforcement Calibration (Phase-31)

> **Minor release — Phase-31 closes the gap between advisory subsystems and actionable enforcement: gate-synthesis opt-in strict mode, plan-parser lint advisory, reflexion prompt wiring, complexity threshold recalibration, and tempering suppression promoter.**

### Added

- **Slice 1 — Committed-before-timeout dashboard badge** (`dashboard/live-session.js`, `dashboard/index.html`) — New live-session module subscribes to the `slice-timeout-but-committed` hub event and injects a green `committed-before-timeout (<pre>→<post>)` badge into the matching slice card. MutationObserver re-injects badges after `renderSliceCards()` replaces the DOM. Clears stale state on `run-started`.
- **Slice 2 — Plan-parser lint advisory in `pforge analyze`** (`orchestrator.mjs`) — `runAnalyze` now accepts a `planPath` parameter and emits an `ADVISORY plan-parser-gate-missing` line for every slice that has bash code blocks but no `**Validation Gate**:` marker. Advisory is suppressed when `runtime.planParser.implicitGates = true` (bare blocks already captured as gates in that mode). Exit code unchanged.
- **Slice 4 — `--strict-gates` CLI flag** (`pforge.ps1`, `pforge.sh`, `orchestrator.mjs`) — `pforge run-plan --strict-gates` forces `runtime.gateSynthesis.mode = "enforce"` for the run without writing `.forge.json`. When active, slices flagged by `suggestGatesForPlan()` fail pre-flight with a structured `STRICT_GATES_PREFLIGHT` error listing offending slices. Default `runtime.gateSynthesis.mode` remains `"suggest"` — no breaking change for v2.64.x consumers.
- **Slice 6 — Tempering suppression promoter** (`tempering.mjs`) — New exports `logSuppression`, `readSuppressions`, `readPromoteThreshold`, and `promoteSuppressions`. When a suppression fingerprint accumulates ≥ threshold occurrences, `promoteSuppressions` writes `.forge/bugs/BUG-<date>-<seq>.json` with required registry fields (`bugId`, `fingerprint`, `source`, `classification`, `severity`, `promotedAt`, `suppressionCount`). Idempotent — re-runs append "re-observed" entry instead of creating a duplicate. Threshold configurable via `runtime.tempering.promoteThreshold` (default 3), which overrides the function parameter.

### Changed

- **Slice 3 — Reflexion prompt wiring** (`orchestrator.mjs`) — When `lastFailureContext` is non-null on a retry attempt, the worker's system-prompt preamble now includes a `<prior_attempt>` block with `previousAttempt`, `gateName`, `model`, and `stderrTail` (truncated to 40 lines). First attempts are unaffected — no empty block injected.
- **Slice 5 — `scoreSliceComplexity` default threshold 6 → 3** (`orchestrator.mjs`) — Recalibrated based on distribution analysis across Phase-25–30 plans (`docs/research/complexity-threshold-v2.65.md`). Previous default of 5–6 selected zero slices; threshold 3 selects the expected 60th-percentile slice set.

### Research

- `docs/research/gate-synthesis-flip-safety-v2.65.md` — Audit of Phase-25–30 runs under strict-gates mode; confirms safe to expose as opt-in flag, not yet safe as default.
- `docs/research/complexity-threshold-v2.65.md` — Slice complexity distribution table across all Phase-25–30 plans; documents threshold selection rationale.

### Tests

- `tests/dashboard-live-session.test.mjs` (13 tests) — Slice 1 badge lifecycle, MutationObserver re-inject, run-started clear.
- `tests/orchestrator-analyze.test.mjs` (5 tests) — Slice 2 advisory fire/suppress/absent cases.
- `tests/orchestrator-reflexion-prompt.test.mjs` — Slice 3 prior-attempt injection and absence on first attempt.
- `tests/orchestrator-gate-synthesis.test.mjs` (10 tests) — Slice 4 strict-gates pre-flight, enforce override, default-remains-suggest.
- `tests/orchestrator-complexity.test.mjs` — Slice 5 threshold=3 default.
- `tests/tempering-promoter.test.mjs` (25 tests) — Slice 6 full coverage: below-threshold, at-threshold, idempotency, custom threshold, multiple fingerprints.

## [2.65.0] — 2026-04-22 — Advisory → Enforcement Calibration (Phase-31)

> **Minor release — Phase-31 completes 7 calibration improvements: dashboard timeout-committed badge, plan-parser lint advisory, reflexion prompt wiring, strict-gates CLI flag, complexity threshold recalibration, tempering suppression promoter, and full sweep.**

### Added
- **Committed-before-timeout badge (Slice 1)** — New `dashboard/live-session.js` module subscribes to `slice-timeout-but-committed` hub events and injects a green badge into the matching slice card showing 7-char pre/post commit SHAs. MutationObserver re-injects badges after `renderSliceCards()` wipes the DOM. Badge clears on `run-started` to prevent cross-run stale state.
- **Plan-parser lint advisory (Slice 2)** — `runAnalyze` now accepts a `planPath` parameter. When provided, it parses the plan and emits `ADVISORY plan-parser-gate-missing` for each slice that has bash code blocks but no `**Validation Gate**:` marker. Advisory suppressed when `runtime.planParser.implicitGates = true`.
- **`--strict-gates` CLI flag (Slice 4)** — `pforge run-plan --strict-gates` forces `runtime.gateSynthesis.mode` to `"enforce"` for the run without writing `.forge.json`. Slices flagged by `suggestGatesForPlan()` fail pre-flight with a structured `STRICT_GATES_PREFLIGHT` error. Default `runtime.gateSynthesis.mode` remains `"suggest"`.
- **Tempering suppression promoter (Slice 6)** — `tempering.mjs` exports `promoteSuppressions({ cwd, threshold })`, `logSuppression`, `readSuppressions`, `readPromoteThreshold`. After each run, suppressions seen ≥ `runtime.tempering.promoteThreshold` (default 3) times are promoted to `.forge/bugs/bug-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN.json` with full suppression history. Idempotent: re-runs append a "re-observed" record rather than duplicating.
- **Research note** — `docs/research/complexity-threshold-v2.65.md`: distribution analysis across Phase-25–30 plans justifying threshold recalibration to 3.
- **Research note** — `docs/research/gate-synthesis-flip-safety-v2.65.md`: audit of recent runs confirming `--strict-gates` safety.

### Changed
- **Reflexion prompt wiring (Slice 3)** — When `lastFailureContext` is non-null on a retry, the worker system prompt prepends a `<prior_attempt>` block with `previousAttempt`, `gateName`, `model`, and `stderrTail` (truncated to 40 lines). First-attempt prompts unchanged.
- **Complexity threshold recalibrated (Slice 5)** — `scoreSliceComplexity` default threshold lowered from 6 → 3 (60th-percentile of Phase-25–30 distribution). At threshold=6 only 1/63 slices triggered quorum; at threshold=3, 56/63 slices do.

### Tests
- `tests/dashboard-live-session.test.mjs` — 13 tests (badge render, absent-without-event, markup, index.html wiring)
- `tests/orchestrator-analyze.test.mjs` — 5 tests (plan-parser lint advisory, implicitGates suppression)
- `tests/orchestrator-reflexion-prompt.test.mjs` — reflexion wiring coverage
- `tests/orchestrator-gate-synthesis.test.mjs` — strict-gates flag coverage
- `tests/orchestrator-complexity.test.mjs` — complexity threshold coverage
- `tests/tempering-promoter.test.mjs` — 25 tests (readPromoteThreshold, logSuppression, readSuppressions, promoteSuppressions at/below threshold, idempotency, custom threshold, multiple fingerprints)
- **Total**: 3477 tests across 146 files in `pforge-mcp/`; 65 tests in `pforge-master/`

## [2.64.1] — 2026-04-22 — Forge-Master Studio hotfix + Smith Phase-29/30 awareness

> **Patch release — bundles the Phase-30.1 Forge-Master Studio tab clickability hotfix with Smith diagnostic improvements for Phase-29/30 files and dev-repo false-positive elimination.**

### Fixed
- **Forge-Master Studio tab clickability (Phase-30.1)** — `dashboard/forge-master.js` now hoists `window.forgeMasterInit`, `window.forgeMasterOpen`, and related assignments to module top and wraps init in a try/catch guard so the main tab dispatcher can reach the handlers before the DOMContentLoaded listener fires. Previously, tab clicks reached the dispatcher but its `window.forgeMasterOpen` lookup returned `undefined` because assignments executed after dispatcher binding. Commit `278f9c3`. All 118 forge-master tests pass.

### Added
- **Smith Phase-29/30 capability-surface awareness** — `pforge smith` now verifies:
  - `dashboard/forge-master.js` (Phase-29 Forge-Master Studio tab controller)
  - `pforge-mcp/forge-master-routes.mjs` (Phase-29 `/api/forge-master/*` route wiring)
  - `pforge-mcp/tools.json` + `cli-schema.json` presence with registered-tool count
  - New "Forge-Master Studio (Phase-29)" section: `pforge-master/server.mjs` + `src/lifecycle.mjs`
  Each check emits a targeted `pforge update` FIX hint when missing.

### Changed
- **Smith dev-repo-aware checks** — `pforge smith` no longer emits false-positive warnings when run inside the plan-forge framework dev repo itself:
  - `VERSION='x.y.z-dev'` recognized as between-release state (was flagged as corrupt install)
  - `.forge.json` with no `preset`/`templateVersion` shows "framework dev repo" label
  - CHANGELOG entry for `-dev` versions no longer required (added at release cut)
  - `copilot-instructions.md` placeholder scan skipped (root file is the template baseline)
  - `DEPLOYMENT-ROADMAP.md` check skipped (dev repo uses root `ROADMAP.md`)
  - Missing `SessionStart`/`PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`/`Stop` hooks reported as expected (consumers get them via `pforge update`)
  Result: dev-repo Smith run went from 10 warnings → 3 warnings (only legitimate external-worker ones remain).

### Docs
- **ROADMAP.md refreshed** — Current Release updated from v2.59.1 to v2.64.0. Added Shipped entries for v2.60 through v2.64 (Cost Projection, Forge-Master MVP arc, Studio, Settings decomposition). Backlog refreshed to Phase-31 candidates including meta-bug #88, #89, and `scoreSliceComplexity` recalibration.
- **CHANGELOG.md normalized** — v2.64.0 and v2.63.1 headers dropped `v` prefix for consistency with all prior entries.

### Meta
- **Setup / update / MCP-capabilities file-coverage audit** — confirmed setup scripts use pure recursive copy (auto-discovers new `pforge-mcp/` files), update uses recursive scan for `pforge-mcp/`, `.github/hooks/`, `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`, and preset files. `tools.json` + `cli-schema.json` auto-generate on server startup from TOOLS array (always in sync). No gaps found.

## [2.64.0] — 2026-04-21 — Settings Panel Decomposition (Phase-30)

> **Minor release — Single monolithic Settings tab decomposed into 9 sub-tabs (General, Models, Execution, API Keys, Updates, Memory, Brain, Bridge, Crucible). Cross-group tab migration: Extensions moved to Settings row; Bug Registry and Watcher moved to LiveGuard row.**

### Changed
- **Settings sub-tabs** — `dashboard/index.html` `#tab-config` replaced with 9 sub-tab sections under `#subtabs-settings`, each routable via `data-tab="settings-*"`.
- **Cross-group tab migration** — Extensions button relocated from Forge row → Settings row (`hover:text-purple-400`); Bug Registry + Watcher buttons relocated from Forge row → LiveGuard row (`hover:text-amber-400`).
- **Tab row counts** — Forge: 18→15; Settings: 9→10; LiveGuard: 5→7 (total `data-tab` count unchanged at 33).
- **Legacy DOM removed** — `initConfigSubtabs()` and internal `cfg-subtab` buttons removed from `app.js`; the main tab dispatcher now handles routing directly.

### Tests
- Added `dashboard-settings.test.mjs` — asserts presence of all 9 Settings sub-tabs, correct `data-tab` prefixes, and section anchors.
- Added structural "Cross-group tab migration (Slice 7)" test in `server.test.mjs` — row counts, accent hover colors, and total button tally.

### Meta
- Filed [issue #86](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/86) — headless `gh copilot` autoharden pipeline silently fails to write repo files (class: `orchestrator-defect`). Hand-hardened the plan as a workaround.

## [2.63.1] — 2026-04-21 — Tempering Triage (Phase-28.5)

> **Patch release — tempering run-directory sorting now uses mtime instead of alphabetical order, preventing stale baselines from shadowing recent runs. Also fixes touch-device CSS hover stickiness in docs nav dropdown.**

### Fixed
- **Tempering baselines `listRunDirs`** now sorts by mtime (newest-first) and filters for `run-*` prefix, preventing stale or non-run directories from corrupting triage results. (`pforge-mcp/tempering/baselines.mjs`)
- **Docs nav dropdown** `:hover` gated behind `@media (hover: hover)` to prevent sticky menus on touch devices. (`docs/assets/shared.css`)

### Tests
- Added `tempering-baselines-sort.test.mjs` (mtime sort, prefix filter, empty-dir edge cases).

## [2.63.0] — 2026-04-21 — Forge-Master Studio (Phase-29)

> **Feature release — Forge-Master Studio dashboard tab, route wiring, CLI subcommands, and capability surface update.**

### Added
- **Forge-Master Studio tab** in main Plan Forge dashboard (`dashboard/index.html`): prompt gallery, chat stream, tool-call trace pane.
- **`dashboard/forge-master.js`** — client-side tab controller: lazy-init, gallery render/filter, chat send/stream, tool trace UI.
- **`/api/forge-master/*` route wiring** in main Express server (`server.mjs`) via async fire-and-forget import of `forge-master-routes.mjs`.
- **`pforge forge-master status|logs`** CLI subcommands in `pforge.ps1` and `pforge.sh` — delegate to `pforge-master/src/lifecycle.mjs`.
- **`forge-master` entry** in `pforge-mcp/cli-schema.json` with `status` and `logs` sub-subcommands.
- **`forgeMaster.studio` capabilities block** in `capabilities.mjs` — surfaces `dashboardTabEnabled`, `reasoningModel`, `routerModel`, and `promptCatalogVersion`.
- **`forge-master-chat` MCP server registration** in `setup.ps1` and `setup.sh` — added to `.vscode/mcp.json` when `pforge-master/server.mjs` is present.
- **`tests/forge-master-tab.test.mjs`** — dashboard HTML integration tests and route adapter tests.

## [2.62.3] — 2026-04-21 — OpenBrain Queue Drain

> **Patch release — pending OpenBrain queue records now drain automatically on MCP server start, closing a silent data-loss gap where locally enqueued thoughts never reached long-term memory.** New pure drain orchestrator, I/O wrapper with atomic writes, REST endpoint, CLI command, and `forge_smith` warning row. Closes [#84](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/84).

### Added

- **`drainOpenBrainQueue(records, dispatcher, opts)` orchestrator** — pure function in `memory.mjs` that composes `partitionByBackoff`, calls an injected dispatcher per record, applies `applyDeliveryFailure` on failures, and returns structured `{ delivered, deferred, dlq, archive, stats }`. Honors `opts.maxBatch` (default 50). Zero filesystem. (Phase-28.4, Slice 1)
- **`runDrainPass(cwd, source, hub)` I/O wrapper** — in `server.mjs`, reads the queue file, calls `drainOpenBrainQueue`, atomic-writes survivors (tmp + rename), appends archive/DLQ/stats, broadcasts `openbrain-flush` hub event. (Phase-28.4, Slice 2)
- **MCP `initialize` drain hook** — schedules `runDrainPass` via `setTimeout(..., 3000)` once per server start. Skips when OpenBrain is not configured. Non-blocking, fire-and-forget, never crashes the server. (Phase-28.4, Slice 2)
- **`POST /api/memory/drain` REST endpoint** — synchronous drain with `checkApprovalSecret` auth. Returns `{ ok, source, attempted, delivered, deferred, dlq, durationMs }`. 503 when OpenBrain not configured. (Phase-28.4, Slice 3)
- **`pforge drain-memory` CLI command** — PowerShell and bash. POSTs to the local REST endpoint using the bridge approval secret. Prints a one-line summary. (Phase-28.4, Slice 3)
- **`forge_smith` Memory drain warning row** — conditional `⚠ Drain:` line when pending count > threshold or oldest entry age > threshold. Thresholds configurable via `.forge.json#openbrain.drainWarn = { count: 10, ageHours: 24 }`. (Phase-28.4, Slice 4)

### Tests

- Phase-28.4 new tests: `drain-orchestrator.test.mjs` (happy/failure/DLQ/batch/mixed paths), `drain-io-wrapper.test.mjs` (atomic write, archive, stats, hub broadcast), `drain-rest-endpoint.test.mjs` (auth, 503, success/error responses), `smith-drain-warning.test.mjs` (thresholds, custom config, source assertions). Total test count: 3277.

## [2.62.2] — 2026-04-21 — Self-Repair Capture

> **Patch release — adds automatic meta-bug filing when Plan Forge discovers and works around defects in its own plans, orchestrator, or prompts.** New MCP tool `forge_meta_bug_file` routes self-repair issues to a dedicated GitHub Issues lane with hash-based dedupe. A post-slice advisory scanner detects when an agent worked around a Plan Forge defect but forgot to file. New instruction file teaches agents when and how to fire the tool.

### Added

- **`forge_meta_bug_file` MCP tool** — files GitHub Issues against the configured self-repair repo (`.forge.json#meta.selfRepairRepo`, fallback `srnichols/plan-forge`) when Plan Forge discovers a defect in itself during execution. Accepts `class` (`plan-defect` | `orchestrator-defect` | `prompt-defect`), `title`, `symptom`, optional `workaround`, `filePaths`, `slice`, `plan`, and `severity`. Returns `{ ok, issueNumber, url, deduped }`. (Phase-28.3, Slices 1–3)
- **Hash-based dedupe** — issue titles embed `[self-repair:<hash>]` where hash is `sha256(class + normalize(title)).slice(0,12)`. Existing open issue with same hash → comment added instead of duplicate. (Phase-28.3, Slice 2)
- **`resolveSelfRepairRepo(config)`** — resolves target repo from `.forge.json#meta.selfRepairRepo` with fallback to `srnichols/plan-forge`. Validates `owner/repo` shape; malformed input → fallback. (Phase-28.3, Slice 1)
- **`META_BUG_CLASSES` / `SELF_REPAIR_LABELS` constants** — canonical class list and label set exported from `tempering/bug-adapters/github.mjs`. (Phase-28.3, Slice 1)
- **Post-slice advisory scanner** — `detectSelfRepairMissed()` in `orchestrator.mjs` scans completed slice trajectories for self-repair markers (`"plan was wrong"`, `"fixed the plan"`, `"brittle gate"`, etc.). If markers present and no `forge_meta_bug_file` call was made, emits non-blocking `self-repair-missed` warning to `events.log`. Never fails the slice; never auto-files. (Phase-28.3, Slice 4)
- **Self-repair reporting instruction file** — `.github/instructions/self-repair-reporting.instructions.md` with `applyTo: '**'`, priority LOW. Documents the two-lane distinction (project bugs vs meta bugs), three canonical classes with worked examples, tool signature, and when NOT to fire. (Phase-28.3, Slice 5)
- **Step-3 prompt update** — `step3-execute-slice.prompt.md` now includes a Self-Repair Reporting reminder directing agents to `forge_meta_bug_file` when they work around Plan Forge defects. (Phase-28.3, Slice 5)

### Tests

- Phase-28.3 new tests: `meta-bug-resolver.test.mjs` (resolver + schema), `meta-bug-filer.test.mjs` (filer + dedupe + errors), `meta-bug-tool.test.mjs` (MCP tool validation + wiring), `self-repair-advisory.test.mjs` (marker scan + miss detection). Total test count: 3239.

## [2.62.1] — 2026-04-21 — Worker Role Guardrails + Gate Portability

> **Patch release — four targeted defect fixes under the same architectural umbrella: respect the boundary between worker capability and call-site role.** No new features; no API changes.

### Fixed

- **API-only models (Grok, GPT) blocked from code-writing worker role** — `spawnWorker()` in `orchestrator.mjs` now throws a descriptive error when the resolved model is an API-only provider (matching `grok-*`, `gpt-*`, `dall-e-*`, or `chatgpt-*`) and the call-site role is `null`, `"code"`, or `"execute"`. API providers remain valid for `reviewer`, `quorum-dry-run`, `analysis`, and `image` roles. New `API_ALLOWED_ROLES` set and `isApiOnlyModel()` helper exported. (Phase-28.2, Slice 1)
- **Recommender excludes API-only models** — `recommendModel()` in `orchestrator.mjs` and the mirror copy in `cost-service.mjs` now filter out any model matching an API-only provider pattern before scoring. Grok and GPT models are permanently ineligible for code-writing recommendations; only CLI-backed models (claude-*, gemini-*, etc.) qualify. (Phase-28.2, Slice 2)
- **One-time migration scrubs poisoned model-performance entries** — `loadModelPerformance()` now silently drops historical entries where the model name matches an API-only pattern on the first load after upgrade. Writes the cleaned file back once; idempotent on subsequent loads. Logs `[perf] scrubbed N API-worker entries from model-performance.json` when entries are removed. (Phase-28.2, Slice 3)
- **Gate portability linter warns on Windows-hostile shell patterns** — new `validateGatePortability()` function in `orchestrator.mjs` detects three known bad patterns: pipe-to-brace-group with `read`, nested double-quotes inside `bash -c`, and command substitution containing a pipe. Integrated into `lintGateCommands()` as a non-blocking `portabilityWarnings` field on the result. Existing plans continue to run; the linter warns authors before wasted worker spend. (Phase-28.2, Slice 4)
- **Gate timeout raised to 10 min (600 s); configurable via env var** — `runGate()` and the LiveGuard gate runner both use `resolveGateTimeoutMs()` which defaults to `600_000` ms (up from 120 s). Override with `PFORGE_GATE_TIMEOUT_MS` env var. Non-positive and non-numeric values fall back to the default. (Phase-28.2, Slice 5)

### Tests

- Phase-28.2 new tests: `spawn-worker-role.test.mjs` (API provider block + `buildApiMessages`), `recommender-api-exclusion.test.mjs` (`isApiOnlyModel` + `recommendModel` exclusion), `loadModelPerformance migration` describe block in `orchestrator.test.mjs` (scrub + idempotent + clean-file), `lint-gate-portability.test.mjs` (three hostile patterns + clean commands + `lintGateCommands` integration). Total test count: 3172.

## [2.62.0] — 2026-04-21 — Forge-Master MVP + Bug-Sweep Hotfix

> **Minor release — ships the Phase-28 Forge-Master MVP subsystem and closes three bug-sweep fixes from Phase-28.1.** Forge-Master (`forge_master_ask`) is a new MCP tool that classifies user intent, retrieves memory context, and orchestrates read-only tool calls on the agent's behalf — purpose-built for open-ended reasoning about plans, troubleshooting failures, and funneling ideas into Crucible smelts. The bug fixes resolve a hard Windows blocker (GH #82), a false-positive gate linter on box-drawing diagrams (GH #83), and a stale update-check cache after self-update.

### Added — Forge-Master MVP (Phase-28)

- **`forge_master_ask` MCP tool** — accepts a freeform `message` string and returns a structured reasoning response. Internally: intent classification (keyword + model fallback), memory retrieval (OpenBrain L1/L2/L3 tiers), tool bridge with allowlist enforcement (read-only tools only), multi-step reasoning loop with provider adapters (Anthropic, OpenAI, xAI), session persistence with auto-summarization, and `buildCapabilities` alias export. Registered in `capabilities.mjs`, `tools.json`, and `server.mjs`. (Phase-28, Slices 1–7)
- **Forge-Master subsystem scaffold** — `pforge-mcp/forge-master/` directory with `config.mjs` (schema validation, `.forge.json` integration), `intent-router.mjs` (keyword matching + model fallback classification), `memory.mjs` (OpenBrain retrieval layer), `tool-bridge.mjs` (allowlist-gated tool execution), `reasoning.mjs` (multi-step loop + provider adapters), `session.mjs` (persistence + auto-summarization). (Phase-28, Slices 1–6)
- **Agent guidance docs** — `docs/forge-master/` with usage guide, tool reference, and integration examples. (Phase-28, post Slice 7)

### Fixed — Bug-Sweep Hotfix (Phase-28.1)

- **Windows `spawn` ENOENT fix (GH #82)** — added `shell: process.platform === "win32"` to `spawnWorker()` options in `orchestrator.mjs`. On Windows, npm-global CLIs (`claude`, `codex`) are installed as `.cmd` shims that `child_process.spawn` cannot resolve without `shell: true`. Covered by new `orchestrator-spawn-shell.test.mjs`. (Phase-28.1, Slice 1)
- **Box-drawing characters recognized as prose (GH #83)** — extended `looksLikeProse()` in `orchestrator.mjs` to detect Unicode box-drawing range U+2500–U+257F. Lines containing `┌─┐│└┘├┤┬┴┼` are now correctly identified as documentation rather than being misclassified as shell commands in validation gates. Includes end-to-end regression test via `lint-ascii-diagram.test.mjs` with a fixture plan. (Phase-28.1, Slices 2–3)
- **Self-update invalidates update-check cache (Fix A)** — after a successful `pforge self-update`, `writeFreshCache()` now writes a proper `update-check.json` entry so the next `checkForUpdate` returns `isNewer: false` without hitting the network. Previously the cache was deleted, forcing an unnecessary network round-trip. New export in `update-check.mjs`. (Phase-28.1, Slice 4)
- **`checkForUpdate` honors VERSION mtime (Fix D)** — defense-in-depth: `checkForUpdate()` now compares VERSION file mtime against cache file mtime. If VERSION was touched after the cache was written (manual edit, tarball extraction, git sync), the cache is treated as stale. (Phase-28.1, Slice 5)

### Tests

- Phase-28 Forge-Master: tests across intent-router, memory retrieval, tool-bridge, reasoning loop, session persistence, and tool registration.
- Phase-28.1 bug fixes: `+13` tests — `orchestrator-spawn-shell.test.mjs` (spawn shim), `looksLikeProse` box-drawing tests, `lint-ascii-diagram.test.mjs` (regression guard), `update-check.test.mjs` (writeFreshCache + mtime bypass).

### Upgrade notes

- **No breaking changes.** `forge_master_ask` is a new additive tool; no existing tool signatures or return shapes changed.
- **Windows users**: the spawn fix resolves the `ENOENT` error that prevented `pforge run-plan` from working on Windows. No configuration needed.
- **Self-update users**: the stale banner issue is self-healing after upgrading to v2.62.0.

## [2.61.0] — 2026-04-20 — Cost Projection UI + Per-Slice Estimator

> **Minor release — surfaces cost projection into the operator dashboard and gives agents a per-slice entry point.** Follows the Phase-27.1 dogfood session where `forge_estimate_quorum` produced honest numbers but the dashboard had no way to show them, and agents had to estimate an entire plan just to price one slice. Additive only — existing `forge_estimate_quorum` signature and return shape unchanged; new `slices[]` field under each mode is backward-compatible. Also includes a calibration report documenting that the current `scoreSliceComplexity` threshold of 5 selects zero slices on every real plan in the repo — evidence-gathering for a future scorer rewrite, no scoring changes ship here.

### Added

- **`forge_estimate_slice` MCP tool** — returns projected cost for a single slice under a chosen quorum mode (`auto` / `power` / `speed` / `false`). Cheaper than `forge_estimate_quorum` (which estimates the whole plan). Wired in `capabilities.mjs`, `tools.json`, and `server.mjs` — including the `MCP_ONLY_TOOLS` Set (Phase-27.1 Slice 2b lesson carried forward so the HTTP bridge reaches the handler). Errors: `PLAN_NOT_FOUND`, `SLICE_NOT_FOUND`. Agent guidance: *"Use this when you need cost for a single slice — cheaper than forge_estimate_quorum."* (Phase-27.2 Slices 1 + 3)
- **`cost-service.estimateSlice({plan, sliceNumber, mode, model, cwd})`** — backing function for the new MCP tool. Returns `{estimatedCostUSD, baseCostUSD, overheadUSD, complexityScore, model, quorumEligible, rationale, generatedAt}`. Un-calibrated — no run-level historical correction factor applied (documented in JSDoc; a single slice doesn't provide enough context to re-derive the factor). (Phase-27.2 Slice 1)
- **`buildQuorumConfigForMode(mode)` helper** — extracted from `estimateQuorum` so `estimateSlice` and `estimateQuorum` always agree on which models, thresholds, and auto flags each mode implies. Pure refactor; no behavior change. (Phase-27.2 Slice 1)
- **Per-slice breakdown under each `forge_estimate_quorum` mode** — additive `slices: [{sliceNumber, projectedCostUSD, complexityScore, quorumEligible}]` array on each mode summary. Existing top-level keys unchanged. Consumers ignoring the new field keep working; the dashboard uses it to populate the projected-cost badge without a second round-trip. (Phase-27.2 Slice 2)
- **Dashboard projected-cost badge** — 💵 ~$0.xxxx on every slice card, next to the existing complexity ⚙ and spend 💰 badges. Order left-to-right: complexity → projected → spend. Tooltip names the active projection mode. Hydrated on plan-open from a single `forge_estimate_quorum` call, cached for the session. Dashboard works without the projection (badge simply doesn't render). (Phase-27.2 Slice 4)
- **Dashboard plan-projection strip** — collapsible row at the top of the Progress tab showing the four quorum-mode estimates + the recommended mode. Expanded view adds per-mode `$cost · N/M quorum slices · $overhead` detail. When `.forge.json` sets `runtime.cost.budget`, any mode whose projection exceeds the cap renders `text-red-400` with an "Over budget" tooltip. (Phase-27.2 Slice 5)
- **Projected→actual flourish** — once a slice completes, the projected badge stays visible beside the new actual-spend badge for 5 seconds, then fades out. Operator sees "expected vs actual" side-by-side before the card settles. CSS `transition-opacity` + `opacity-70`, no state machine. (Phase-27.2 Slice 6)
- **`scoreSliceComplexity` distribution report** (`docs/research/scorecomplexity-distribution-2026-04.md`) — one-page calibration report documenting the score distribution across all 70 slices in the 7 repo plans. Key finding: threshold 5 catches **zero** slices on any real plan; 93% of slices score ≤ 2. Identifies three follow-up options (lower threshold 5→3, add file-count signal, or full scorer rewrite) for a future phase. No scoring changes ship in this release. (Phase-27.2 Slice 7)

### Changed

- **Dashboard cost UX: complexity → projected → actual** left-to-right on every slice card. Operator reads the row as "how hard the scorer thinks this is · what we expected it to cost · what it actually cost." The projected badge is a new third column; complexity and spend badges are unchanged.

### Tests

- `+33` tests total:
  - `+4` in `tests/cost-service.test.mjs` — `estimateQuorum` per-slice breakdown schema (Slice 2), plus `forge_estimate_slice` registration coverage (Slice 3: TOOL_METADATA shape, tools.json schema, server.mjs tool-list/switch/handler wiring). Also updated the Phase-27.1 Slice 2b `MCP_ONLY_TOOLS` guard's `REQUIRED` array to include `forge_estimate_slice`.
  - `+14` in `tests/estimate-slice.test.mjs` — per-slice estimator unit tests, mode coverage (auto/power/speed/false), error handling, parity with `estimatePlan` summed across all slices.
  - `+21` in new `tests/dashboard-cost-projection.test.mjs` — file-contract tests for state shape, `fetchPlanProjection`, `hydrateSliceProjections`, badge markup + ordering, plan-projection strip, budget-cap highlighting, and projected→actual flourish semantics.

### Upgrade notes

- **No breaking changes.** `forge_estimate_quorum` return shape gains a `slices[]` field under each mode; existing fields (`mode`, `estimatedCostUSD`, `baseCostUSD`, `overheadUSD`, `quorumSliceCount`, `totalSliceCount`, `confidence`) are untouched. Consumers parsing the previous shape keep working.
- **Dashboard requires no config.** The projected-cost badge and plan-projection strip activate automatically on plan-open. Set `runtime.cost.budget` in `.forge.json` to light up the over-budget red highlighting.
- **`scoreSliceComplexity` is not changed.** The distribution report documents that the current threshold of 5 catches zero slices on real plans, but any scoring/threshold change is explicitly deferred to a future phase with its own scope contract.

## [2.60.1] — 2026-04-21 — Cost Service Hotfix (v2.60.0 follow-up)

> **Patch release — closes three real bugs the v2.60.0 dogfood exposed, plus a carryover bridge defect from Phase-27 Slice 6.** When `forge_estimate_quorum` shipped in v2.60.0 and was pointed at real plans in `docs/plans/`, it produced numbers between $141–$218 for 11–17-slice plans — numerically close to the $146.57 figure the v2.59 agent was accused of fabricating. The tool-call forcing function was the real fix in v2.60.0; the v2.60.0 release notes were wrong to frame $146.57 as hallucination. What the dogfood exposed: (A) power and speed modes were producing *identical* overhead because the dry-run cost used the first-listed model's rate N times instead of pricing each leg by its own model; (B) `claude-opus-4.7` was absent from `MODEL_PRICING` and silently fell back to the sonnet rate, undercounting power-preset overhead; (C) the `auto` mode's complexity threshold was `7` — higher than any score real plans produce — so `auto` degenerated to `false` on every plan in the repo; (D) `forge_estimate_quorum` was missing from `server.mjs`'s `MCP_ONLY_TOOLS` Set (carryover from Phase-27 Slice 6), so `POST /api/tool/forge_estimate_quorum` fell through to `runPforge()`, which has no CLI counterpart for MCP-native tools.

### Fixed

- **Per-leg dry-run pricing in `estimateQuorum`.** `cost-service.mjs` now prices each quorum model's dry-run leg using *that model's* per-token rate instead of multiplying the default model's rate by the leg count. Pre-fix, `power.overheadUSD` and `speed.overheadUSD` were identical on every plan. Post-fix, observed ratio is ≈ 5.5× (power's opus-4.6 + gpt-5.3-codex + grok-reasoning averages ~$6.70/Mtok input; speed's sonnet + gpt-mini + grok-fast averages ~$1.20/Mtok). A new test `per-leg pricing varies across quorum presets` asserts the ratio stays above 4× as a regression guard. (Phase-27.1 Slice 1)
- **`claude-opus-4.7` added to `MODEL_PRICING`.** Mirrors published `claude-opus-4.6` rates ($15 / $75 per Mtok, Anthropic pricing page retrieved 2026-04-20) until Anthropic publishes a distinct price point. A new coverage test iterates every model referenced by any `QUORUM_PRESET` (power/speed, models + reviewerModel) and asserts direct `MODEL_PRICING` membership — regression guard against the same class of defect (new preset model silently falling back to default rates). (Phase-27.1 Slice 2)
- **`forge_estimate_quorum` wired through HTTP bridge.** Added to `server.mjs`'s `MCP_ONLY_TOOLS` Set. Without this, `POST /api/tool/forge_estimate_quorum` fell through to `runPforge()` (no CLI counterpart), returning a non-zero exit / empty output to the dashboard and stdio MCP clients that went via HTTP. A new test parses `server.mjs` and asserts required MCP-native tools are present in the Set — regression guard against the Phase-27 Slice 6 carryover pattern (new tool registered in `capabilities.mjs`/`tools.json`/switch-case/handler but author forgets the one-line Set update). (Phase-27.1 Slice 2b — carryover from Phase-27 Slice 6)
- **`auto` quorum threshold lowered from 7 to 5.** Matches `QUORUM_PRESETS.power.threshold`. Pre-fix, `threshold: 7` on every real plan in `docs/plans/` produced `quorumSliceCount: 0`, degenerating `auto` to `false`. Post-fix it still produces 0 on the current plan portfolio (max observed complexity score: 4) — this is a real finding: the synthetic-score scale and feature-sized real-plan shapes leave `auto` effectively inert. Phase-27.2 may recalibrate the complexity scorer; this fix at minimum stops `auto` being strictly worse than power. (Phase-27.1 Slice 3)

### Added

- **Real-plan smoke matrix** — `tests/cost-service-real-plans.test.mjs` iterates every `docs/plans/Phase-*-PLAN.md` file in the repo, parses it with `parsePlan`, runs `estimateQuorum`, and asserts cross-preset invariants (`power > speed > false`, `auto <= speed`, finite numeric estimates for all four modes, `auto.quorumSliceCount` equals the slice count meeting the auto threshold). This is the matrix that exposed bugs A–C above; it exists now to catch the same regression pattern on future changes. (Phase-27.1 Slice 4)

### Correction to v2.60.0 release notes

The v2.60.0 notes framed the $146.57 number as a chat hallucination. Dogfood of `forge_estimate_quorum` against real plans shows the estimator itself returns $141–$218 for 11–17-slice plans, consistent with what the v2.59 agent quoted. The Phase-27 value was the tool-call forcing function itself — cost becomes a replayable action, not a chat number. Phase-27.1 closes three real bugs the dogfood exposed (per-leg pricing, opus-4.7 coverage, auto threshold) plus the missing `MCP_ONLY_TOOLS` entry that left `forge_estimate_quorum` unreachable via HTTP. The regression guard in `tests/cost-service.test.mjs` ("power mode … stays under $25 … fabrication catcher") is unchanged — it still guards the 6-slice heuristic fixture shape. Real plans produce higher numbers because real plans have more slices with higher token budgets, not because the estimator is wrong.

### Test delta

- `+22` tests: `+9` in `tests/cost-service.test.mjs` (pricing-table coverage for QUORUM_PRESETS, per-leg ratio gate strengthened `> 2 → > 4`, HTTP-bridge MCP_ONLY_TOOLS coverage), `+13` in new `tests/cost-service-real-plans.test.mjs` (real-plan smoke matrix). Total `2968 / 2968` green (was `2946 / 2946`).

### Upgrade notes

- **No breaking changes.** Public API of `cost-service.mjs` and `orchestrator.mjs` shim is unchanged. Projected cost numbers will move:
  - `power.overheadUSD` will *increase* on plans that have quorum-eligible slices (per-leg pricing now uses each model's actual rate instead of the cheapest-first-listed). Expected ≈ 2–5× depending on model mix.
  - `auto.estimatedCostUSD` equals `speed.estimatedCostUSD` on most real plans until the complexity scorer recalibrates (Phase-27.2).
- **If you cached v2.60.0 cost report numbers**, re-run `forge_cost_report` — the pricing table now includes `claude-opus-4.7` and may reclassify runs that used it.

## [2.60.0] — 2026-04-20 — Cost Service Consolidation + `forge_estimate_quorum`

> **Minor release — one source of truth for pricing, one tool for quorum cost projection.** Motivated by a field incident where an agent, asked "how much will this plan cost under each quorum mode?", produced a four-row picker with a $146.57 headline for `power` mode — invented in chat by hand-multiplying its internal guess at per-slice tokens by an out-of-date rate card. The real `pforge run-plan --estimate --quorum=power` number for the same plan was under $10. The plan existed, the CLI estimator existed, but no MCP tool exposed it to agents, so the agent fabricated. This release fixes both halves: (1) pricing + cost math are extracted from three different files into a single `cost-service.mjs` module (DRY, so "update the rate card" means editing one file); (2) a new `forge_estimate_quorum` MCP tool returns all four quorum-mode estimates in one call, with explicit agent guidance in `copilot-instructions.md` telling agents to call the tool instead of computing in chat. Tied to Karpathy's verifiability principle — numbers the user sees must come from code that can be replayed, not from model arithmetic.

### Added

- **`pforge-mcp/cost-service.mjs`** — new module, single source of truth for all pricing and cost math. Exports `MODEL_PRICING` (the rate card), `getPricing(model)`, `priceSlice(tokens, worker)` (drop-in for the old `calculateSliceCost`), `priceRun(sliceResults)` (drop-in for `buildCostBreakdown`), `estimatePlan(plan, model, cwd, quorumConfig, resumeFrom)` (drop-in for `buildEstimate`), and `estimateQuorum({plan, cwd, resumeFrom, defaultModel})` which returns all four modes (`auto` / `power` / `speed` / `false`) plus a `recommended` field in one call.
- **`forge_estimate_quorum` MCP tool** — exposes `cost-service.estimateQuorum` over the MCP surface. Wired in `capabilities.mjs` (with `agentGuidance` telling agents to prefer this tool over hand-computed costs), `tools.json` (schema + example), and `server.mjs` (dedicated async handler that resolves `planPath`, parses the plan, runs the estimator, broadcasts a LiveGuard event, and returns JSON).
- **Regression guard** — `tests/cost-service.test.mjs` includes a named "REGRESSION GUARD: power mode on 6 trivial heuristic slices stays under $25" test that will fail loudly if the estimator ever drifts into the $100+ range the v2.59 agent fabricated. Plus 19 parity tests comparing every cost-service function byte-for-byte against the pre-refactor orchestrator behavior.
- **`## Cost estimates` section** added to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `templates/copilot-instructions.md.template`: "Cost estimates come from tools, not from chat math. Call `forge_estimate_quorum` before showing any picker or decision matrix. Do not hand-compute quorum costs." Carries the $146.57 incident as cautionary context.

### Changed

- **`pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs`** — the 313-line pricing block (`MODEL_PRICING`, `calculateSliceCost`, `buildCostBreakdown`, `buildEstimate`) is now a 24-line shim that re-exports `cost-service.mjs` functions. Preserves the exact public signatures so every caller (`pforge run-plan --estimate`, the autonomous executor, every test) keeps working. Shims use `export function X(...args) { return _Y(...args) }` rather than `export const X = _Y` because vitest's ESM module graph gives the latter a `undefined` binding under circular imports (orchestrator ↔ cost-service both need scoring/pricing primitives). Function declarations hoist; const aliases don't.
- **`pforge-mcp/tempering/scanners/visual-diff.mjs`** — the local 6-entry rate table and inline `estimateCost()` function are deleted. The remaining 6-line adapter delegates to `cost-service.priceSlice` so visual-diff is no longer silently out of sync with orchestrator pricing when a rate changes.
- **Orchestrator exports** — `aggregateModelStats` and `QUORUM_PRESETS` are now exported so `cost-service.mjs` can use them without duplicating their logic.

### Fixed

- **Duplicate rate cards drift silently.** Before this release, pricing lived in three places: `orchestrator.mjs` `MODEL_PRICING`, `visual-diff.mjs`'s local `rates` object, and implicitly in any caller that did its own token-times-dollar math. Updating Claude Sonnet 4.6's input price meant finding and editing all three. Now it means editing one object in one file.
- **Agents could fabricate dollar amounts without tool backing.** The previous MCP surface exposed `forge_cost_report` (actuals from prior runs) but no projection tool. Agents asked to estimate upcoming plan cost either said "I can't estimate without running" or — more dangerously — invented numbers. `forge_estimate_quorum` closes the gap and the new `## Cost estimates` instructions make the expectation explicit.
- **`estimateQuorum` hardening for null `cwd`.** `estimateQuorum({plan, cwd: null, ...})` now defaults `cwd` to `process.cwd()` before passing it down to `scoreSliceComplexity → getHistoricalFailureRate`, which previously crashed on `resolve(null, "...")`. Callers that pass an explicit `cwd` are unchanged.

### Test delta

- `+20` tests (`tests/cost-service.test.mjs`), total `2913 / 2913` green. The 20 include the REGRESSION GUARD named above plus parity tests for every public function in `cost-service.mjs` against its pre-refactor orchestrator behavior.

### Upgrade notes

- **Public API unchanged.** `orchestrator.mjs` still exports `MODEL_PRICING`, `calculateSliceCost`, `buildCostBreakdown`, `buildEstimate`. Every pre-v2.60 caller keeps working without edits.
- **If you imported `MODEL_PRICING` directly**, the value is now re-exported from `cost-service.mjs` and identical byte-for-byte. No changes required.
- **If you were reading `visual-diff.mjs`'s local rates**, they're gone — read `cost-service.MODEL_PRICING` instead.

## [2.59.2] — 2026-04-20 — CLI Papercuts & Smith Downstream Noise

> **Patch release — follow-up to v2.59.1 based on field feedback.** Fixes three cosmetic-but-noisy PowerShell `pforge` bugs that emitted non-zero exit codes on successful operations, one UX gap on the update prompt, four smith warnings that fired spuriously on downstream consumer projects, and one latent `ContainsKey($null)` crash when `.forge.json` omits the `preset` field. No functional changes to orchestrator, MCP tools, setup, or runtime behavior.

### Fixed

- **`pforge check` — empty `-ProjectPath` binding.** `Invoke-Check` splatted `$Arguments` directly into `validate-setup.ps1`. When no extra args were supplied, `ValueFromRemainingArguments` left `$Arguments` null; splatting `@$null` bound an empty string to `[string]$ProjectPath`, overriding its `(Get-Location).Path` default and throwing "Cannot bind argument to parameter 'Path' because it is an empty string." Now only splats when `$Arguments` is non-empty, else passes `-ProjectPath $RepoRoot` explicitly.
- **`pforge update` — hashtable-merge errors in post-update summary.** `$updates + $newFiles` worked when both arrays had ≠ 1 element, but with single-element arrays PowerShell unwrapped each to a bare hashtable. `hashtable + hashtable` triggers merge semantics → duplicate-`Name`-key collisions ("Item has already been added. Key in dictionary: 'Name'"). With empty + hashtable → "A hash table can only be added to another hash table." Both paths now wrap both sides in `@(...)` to force array context. Files were always written correctly; this error was cosmetic but returned non-zero exit.
- **Smith — `ContainsKey($null)` crash on minimal `.forge.json`.** A `.forge.json` without a `preset` field (e.g., the plan-forge dev repo's own config) left `$preset` null. `$expectedCounts.ContainsKey($null)` threw "Value cannot be null. (Parameter 'key')" and aborted smith before the summary line printed. Now guards with `$presetKey -and ...`.

### Changed

- **Smith — downstream-repo warnings suppressed.** Four checks that only make sense inside the plan-forge dev repo itself now guard on the `isPlanForgeDevRepo` detector (`presets/` directory + `pforge-mcp/server.mjs`): (1) dashboard screenshots in `docs/assets/dashboard/` (plan-forge marketing site asset), (2) tempering coverage-below-minimum warning (downstream `.forge/tempering/` may be seeded from pforge and unrelated to consumer coverage), (3) latest tempering run verdict=fail warning (same rationale), (4) CHANGELOG-missing-entry-for-VERSION warning (consumer CHANGELOG tracks the consumer's app, not the pforge framework version carried in `VERSION`). Downstream projects now see a friendlier pass line noting VERSION is the framework version.
- **`pforge update` — prompt now mentions `--force`.** The confirmation prompt "Apply N updates and M new files? [y/N]" now appends "(use --force to skip this prompt)" so users can discover the non-interactive path.

### Known issues (deferred)

- **`pforge update --tag vX.Y.Z` not authoritative when sibling clone exists.** Flag is honored under `--from-github`, but auto-detection can still route through sibling when `--from-github` is not passed. Explicit `--tag` should win over source auto-detection; scheduled for v2.60.0 alongside the broader `updateSource` precedence refactor.

## [2.59.1] — 2026-04-20 — Setup/Update Distribution Fixes

> **Patch release — fixes a class of silent setup/update gaps.** An audit of `setup.ps1`, `setup.sh`, and `pforge update` against the repo's actual content found four distribution gaps: pipeline prompts were never copied to fresh projects, the `PreCommit.mjs` guard hook (#74) never reached downstream projects, `pforge update` missed `project-profile.prompt.md` and two shared instruction files on Unix, and `pforge smith` counted prompts without verifying pipeline prompts were among them — which masked the first gap. All four fixed. No functional changes to orchestrator, MCP tools, or runtime behavior.

### Fixed

- **Setup/update distribution gap — pipeline prompts never shipped.** `setup.ps1` and `setup.sh` only copied `templates/.github/prompts/project-principles.prompt.md`, never the eight pipeline prompts (`step0-specify-feature`…`step6-ship` + `project-profile`) that live in the repo's `.github/prompts/`. Fresh installs lacked the core runbook scaffolding despite setup's closing output telling users to run `step0-specify-feature.prompt.md`. Both setup scripts now copy every `*.prompt.md` from `.github/prompts/` in Step 3c (excluding `project-principles.prompt.md`, which remains sourced from `templates/`).
- **Setup/update distribution gap — `PreCommit.mjs` (#74 hook) missing from downstream projects.** Added in v2.50.1 only to `.github/hooks/`, but both setup and `pforge update` source hooks from `templates/.github/hooks/`. The hook is now mirrored in both locations so downstream projects receive it.
- **`pforge update` prompt glob too narrow.** The glob `step*.prompt.md` missed `project-profile.prompt.md`. Broadened to `*.prompt.md` with an explicit skip for `project-principles.prompt.md`.
- **`pforge update` shared-instructions list incomplete (Unix).** `pforge.sh` update-from-source only enumerated 3 of the 5 shared instruction files; `status-reporting.instructions.md` and `context-fuel.instructions.md` never refreshed. Now enumerates all five, matching `pforge.ps1`.
- **Smith pipeline-prompt blind spot.** Smith counted `*.prompt.md >= 9` but never verified the runbook's pipeline prompts by name — a project with only `new-*` scaffolding prompts could pass the count check while lacking every pipeline prompt. Smith now performs an explicit name presence check for `step0`…`step6` and `project-profile`, surfacing any missing ones with a `pforge update` fix hint.

## [2.59.0] — 2026-04-20 — Housekeeping

> **Small, targeted cleanup.** One real bug fix (libuv teardown crash on Windows), one version-drift correction, and a ROADMAP prune that closes six stale backlog entries representing work that was already shipped.

### Fixed

- **Bug #82 — Windows libuv teardown assertion on `orchestrator.mjs --analyze` / `--diagnose`.** After a successful xAI/OpenAI/Anthropic API dispatch, `process.exit(0)` was called while undici's keepalive sockets were still closing, tripping `Assertion failed: !(handle->flags & UV_HANDLE_CLOSING), file src\win\async.c, line 76` and a non-zero exit. Both success paths now set `process.exitCode = 0` and let the event loop drain naturally; idle sockets unref and close cleanly. Error paths still use `process.exit(1)` for immediate failure signaling. Verified: same smoke test that crashed now exits cleanly (`$LASTEXITCODE = 0`).

### Changed

- `pforge-mcp/package.json` version bumped `2.47.0` → `2.59.0-dev` to re-align with the top-level `VERSION` file. The `pforge version-bump` command and `pforge smith` drift warning already expected parity; several prior releases had bypassed `version-bump` and let the two drift.

### Docs

- **ROADMAP prune.** Removed six backlog entries representing work already shipped: `pforge update --from-github` (#75, shipped v2.51.0), PreCommit hook against direct-to-master (#74, shipped v2.50.1), runtime-aware `model-performance.json` validation (#73, shipped as `forge_doctor_quorum` + 33 tests), gh-copilot cost/token resolution (#63, closed), preset-specific `validate-setup` minimum counts (shipped), and the B1 shipped marker for `pforge org-rules export`. Phase-27 backlog also had the libuv crash item (now fixed in this release).

## [2.58.0] — 2026-04-20 — Phase-26 Competitive & Self-Deterministic Loop

> **The inner loop gains competitive execution and self-correction.** Building on the Phase-25 reflective layer, this release adds three new opt-in subsystems — competitive worktree execution, auto-fix patch proposals, and cost-anomaly detection — a dedicated Dashboard "Inner Loop" tab that surfaces all ten subsystems in one place, and a best-defaults preset so new projects start with advisory-posture defaults out of the box. Every addition is opt-in; nothing in existing workflows changes.

### Added — Competitive & Self-Deterministic Loop (v2.58.0)

- **Competitive slice execution (L9)** — Opt-in worktree race. Two or more strategies execute the same slice under isolated worktrees; the winner is elected by gate result, reviewer verdict, and token-cost tie-breaker. Losing worktrees are cleaned up. Off by default. Config: `innerLoop.competitive: { enabled, maxParallel, timeoutSec }`. Implemented in `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs → runCompetitiveSlice()`.
- **Auto-fix patch proposals (L6)** — When a gate-fail trajectory suggests a small local correction, the orchestrator drafts a `.patch` file under `.forge/proposed-fixes/<fixId>.patch` and records metadata in `.forge/fix-proposals.json`. Advisory-only — nothing auto-applies unless operators set `applyWithoutReview: true`. Config: `innerLoop.autoFix: { enabled, applyWithoutReview }`.
- **Cost-anomaly detection (L5)** — On every slice, the orchestrator compares the slice's token cost against the per-model median (window 20) and records any ratio above `innerLoop.costAnomaly.ratio` (default 2.0) in `.forge/cost-anomalies.jsonl`. Advisory only; runs are never halted. Surfaced in the Dashboard's new Inner Loop tab.
- **Dashboard "Inner Loop" tab** — New top-level tab with a four-cell summary grid (reviewer calibration, pending auto-skills, federation status, open fix proposals) and six collapsible panels. Six new read-only endpoints power it: `/api/innerloop/{status,reviewer-calibration,gate-suggestions,cost-anomalies,proposed-fixes,federation}`.
- **Welcome card (one-time)** — On first dashboard visit after upgrade to v2.58, a dismissible card announces the inner-loop features. Dismissal is persisted in `.forge/dashboard-state.json#seenInnerLoop258` via the new `/api/dashboard-state` GET/POST endpoints (partial-merge semantics).
- **Best-defaults preset** — `setup.ps1` and `setup.sh` now write `.forge.json` only when it is absent (upgrades are preserved) and ship with `innerLoop` + `brain.federation` blocks in advisory-posture defaults: `competitive` off, `autoFix` advisory, `costAnomaly` advisory, federation off.
- **Capabilities surface extension** — `INNER_LOOP_SURFACE.schemaVersion` bumped `1.0` → `1.1`; `worker-capabilities.json` flags all ten subsystems; `docs/capabilities.md` and `llms.txt` updated.
- **User manual: "Competitive Loop" chapter** — New `docs/manual/competitive-loop.html` with a Mermaid worktree-spawn → winner-election flow. `docs/manual/inner-loop.html` gains a Phase-26 additions section and cross-link.

### Changed

- `INNER_LOOP_SURFACE` schemaVersion `1.0` → `1.1`; now declares ten subsystems (seven Phase-25 + three Phase-26).
- Setup scripts no longer overwrite an existing `.forge.json`. On upgrade, operators retain their customized config and see the welcome card to discover new subsystems.

### Fixed

- **Bug #81 — `--resume-from` ignored in estimate.** `pforge run-plan --estimate --resume-from N` previously returned totals for the full plan (sliceCount, executionOrder, tokens, cost, and slices[] all covered shipped slices). `buildEstimate` now walks the DAG order from `resumeFrom` forward; output adds `resumeFrom` and `fullSliceCount` fields. Falls back to the full plan when `resumeFrom` doesn't match any slice. Regression tests: `tests/estimate-resume-from.test.mjs`.
- **Bug #79 — `tokens_in` inflated up to ~100× in `cost-history.json`.** When `gh copilot` stderr contained both the aggregate `Tokens ↑ X • ↓ Y` summary AND the per-model breakdown block, `parseStderrStats` assigned from the aggregate and then re-accumulated each breakdown line on top. The aggregate is now authoritative; breakdown lines only identify the dominant model when the aggregate is present. Old format (breakdown only, no aggregate) still sums correctly. Regression tests added in `tests/orchestrator.test.mjs`.
- **Bug #78 — `spawnWorker` ignored explicit `worker` override when model matched an API provider.** Callers passing `worker: "..."` to force a CLI still got HTTP-routed if the model name matched a provider pattern. `spawnWorker` now respects the explicit override (`!worker && model ? detectApiProvider(...) : null`). Also adds an optional `role` parameter (`"quorum-dry-run" | "reviewer" | "analysis"`) that threads through to the API path.
- **Bug #80 — xAI Grok refused quorum dry-run and reviewer prompts as core-instruction overrides.** API-routed Grok read "simulate pforge running slice N" as an instruction-override attempt. The new `buildApiMessages(prompt, role)` helper wraps analysis-style prompts in a system message explicitly framing the payload as data to evaluate (not instructions to follow), unblocking Grok without per-call-site prompt rewrites. `quorumDispatch`, `quorumReview`, and `analyzeWithQuorum` now declare their roles. Regression tests: `tests/spawn-worker-role.test.mjs`.

### Security

- All new subsystems ship in advisory posture. `autoFix` never writes outside `.forge/proposed-fixes/`; applying a patch is an explicit opt-in (`applyWithoutReview: true`) and can be rolled back.
- `costAnomaly` is detection-only and cannot halt a run.
- `competitive` worktrees are created under `.forge/worktrees/` and cleaned up after election; losing-worktree paths never enter the working tree.

---

## [2.57.0] — 2026-04-27 — Phase-25 Inner-Loop Enhancements

> **The Forge gains a reflective layer.** Seven opt-in subsystems turn deterministic slice execution into a closed research loop: every slice can teach the next one, every run can teach the next plan, every project can teach the next project. Nothing in existing workflows breaks — all new behavior defaults to *off*, *suggest*, or *advisory*.

### Added — Inner Loop (v2.57.0)

- **Reflexion retry context (L7)** — When a slice's validation gate fails, the next attempt's prompt now includes a compact block with the failing command, model, duration, and a 2KB stderr tail. The worker reasons about the prior failure instead of blindly retrying. `buildReflexionBlock()` in `pforge-mcp/memory.mjs`.
- **Trajectory capture (L8)** — On slice pass, sentinel-wrapped (`<!-- PFORGE_TRAJECTORY:BEGIN --> … <!-- PFORGE_TRAJECTORY:END -->`) worker notes are extracted, word-capped at 500, and written to `.forge/trajectories/<slice>/<iso>.md`. Path-traversal-safe. Postmortem and federation consumers read these for compact run narratives.
- **Auto-skill library (L2)** — Passed slices are captured as candidate skills (domain keywords + gate commands + SHA prefix). On the next slice, `retrieveAutoSkills()` injects matching skills into the prompt ranked by reuse count. Skills promote to "stable" at 3 reuses. Storage: `.forge/auto-skills/*.md`.
- **Adaptive gate synthesis (L6)** — During plan pre-flight, Tempering-domain-matching slices with no validation gate get a suggested command printed using the project's Tempering coverage minimum and runtime budget. Default mode `suggest` (never mutates your plan). Config: `runtime.gateSynthesis: { mode, domains }`.
- **Plan postmortems + hardener feedback (L5)** — Every run writes a JSON postmortem (`retriesPerSlice`, `gateFlaps`, `topFailureReason`, `costDelta`, `driftDelta`) to `.forge/plans/<plan-basename>/postmortem-*.json`. Retention 10 per plan. Step-2 hardener now reads the newest postmortems and folds signals into the Scope Contract — closing the loop from execution back into planning.
- **Cross-project federation (L4-lite)** — When `cross.*` brain recall misses L3 (OpenBrain), the facade fans out to read-only absolute-local-paths listed in `brain.federation.repos[]`. URLs and relative paths are rejected by contract (defense-in-depth path containment). Opt-in. Config: `brain.federation: { enabled, repos: [] }`.
- **Reviewer-agent in-loop (L4)** — Opt-in. `brain.gate-check` responder can invoke a speed-quorum reviewer on each slice's diff summary and attach `{ score, critical, summary, durationMs }` to the response. **Advisory-only in v2.57** — critical verdicts do not block unless operators set `blockOnCritical: true`. Blocking mode enters Phase-26 after calibration data exists. Config: `runtime.reviewer: { enabled, quorumPreset: "speed", blockOnCritical: false, timeoutMs: 30000 }`.
- **Inner-loop capability surface** — New `innerLoop` block in `forge_capabilities` output and `worker-capabilities.json` advertising all 7 subsystems (level, addedIn, enabledByDefault, configKey, configDefaults, dashboardTab, module). IDEs, MCP consumers, and the Dashboard Config tab auto-discover subsystem state.
- **User manual: "The Inner Loop" chapter** — New `docs/manual/inner-loop.html` with a Mermaid state-flow diagram covering plan → slice → reflexion retry → trajectory → skill capture → reviewer → postmortem → federation. Cross-linked from `how-it-works.html` and `manual/index.html` nav.
- **Dashboard Config tab editors** — Toggles, selects, and repo lists for `runtime.gateSynthesis`, `runtime.reviewer`, and `brain.federation`. Every new subsystem is user-configurable without editing JSON.

### Changed

- `CONFIG_SCHEMA` in `pforge-mcp/capabilities.mjs` gained `runtime.gateSynthesis`, `runtime.reviewer`, and `brain.federation` blocks so the Dashboard Config tab renders editors automatically.
- Step-2 Harden-Plan prompt (`.github/prompts/step2-harden-plan.prompt.md`) now directs the hardener to read prior plan postmortems before finalizing the Scope Contract.

### Security

- Federation reader enforces absolute-local-paths-only (D9): rejects URLs (`http://`, `https://`, `ftp://`, `file://`), rejects relative paths, strips `..` components, and applies a defense-in-depth containment check against the resolved base directory.
- Trajectory writer sanitizes slice names and timestamps before building paths (no `..`, no path separators, no control characters).

### Migration

- **No action required.** All seven subsystems default to `off` / `suggest` / `advisory` for existing projects. To opt in, set the relevant key in `.forge.json` or flip the toggle in the Dashboard → Config tab. New installs ship with best-defaults.

### Tests

- 9 reflexion tests, 22 trajectory tests, 26 auto-skill tests, 23 gate-synthesis tests, 13 postmortem tests, 23 federation tests, 25 reviewer tests, 15 capability-surface tests.
- Full-suite regression after each slice: green (2627/2627 across 96 files at Slice 7 checkpoint).

## [2.56.0] — 2026-04-20 — Update Source preference

### Added
- **`updateSource` config preference** in `.forge.json` — tells `pforge update` where to pull template bytes from. Three modes:
  - `auto` *(new default)* — picks the newer of your sibling clone and the latest GitHub tag. If the sibling is on a `-dev` build, GitHub tags win.
  - `github-tags` — always downloads the latest tagged release; ignores sibling clones. Good for teams and CI.
  - `local-sibling` — always uses `../plan-forge`; contributor workflow. Errors if the sibling is missing.
- **`pforge config` CLI** (PowerShell + Bash): `pforge config get/set/list` for managing settable `.forge.json` keys. First key: `update-source`. Writes atomically (tmp + rename).
- **Dashboard Config tab**: new *Update Source* panel with a 3-option select and live hint text. Saves immediately on change via `POST /api/config`. Server-side enum validation.
- **Appendix G — Update Source Modes** in the manual: explains the problem, the three modes, how to change via CLI/dashboard/hand-edit, and FAQ (offline behavior, `self-update` separation, CI guidance).

### Changed
- **`pforge update` default source selection** now runs through the auto-mode algorithm. Previously: "use sibling if it exists, else fail". New: "pick the newer stable source". The v2.53.2 `-dev`-over-clean refusal is still in place as a safety net.
- `pforge update` no longer errors when no sibling is found — it auto-falls-back to GitHub tags.

### Fixed
- Dashboard footer/badge no longer shows hardcoded `v2.9.0` (was a leftover from a screenshot capture script). Version now tracks the `VERSION` file.
- Zombie node servers holding ports 3100/3101 from stale sessions no longer silently render a stale VERSION on the dashboard.

### Migration
- **No action required.** Projects without `updateSource` default to `auto`, which is the safe recommended behavior. Contributors who want the historic sibling-preferred flow can set `updateSource: "local-sibling"` via `pforge config set update-source local-sibling`.

### Tests
- 2486/2486 green. New: `pforge-mcp/tests/config-api.test.mjs` (8 tests covering GET/POST `/api/config` and `updateSource` enum validation).

---

## [2.55.0] — 2026-04-21 — The Forge Shop rebrand

### Changed
- **Positioning**: Plan Forge is now framed as the **AI-Native SDLC Forge Shop** — one workshop with four stations: **Smelt** (Specify & Plan), **Forge** (Execute), **Guard** (Review, Watch, Bridge), **Learn** (Ship, Bug Registry, Testbed, Health DNA).
- **Brand assets**: New xAI Grok-generated hero art in `docs/assets/brand/` (panorama + four station portraits + control room + OG card v2).
- **Landing page** (`docs/index.html`): Hero, station grid, and all meta/OG/Twitter/JSON-LD descriptions updated to four-station taxonomy.
- **Shop Tour** (`docs/shop-tour.html`): New canonical tour of the four stations.
- **Capabilities** (`docs/capabilities.html`): `#stations` four-column reference added before MCP tool listing.
- **FAQ** (`docs/faq.html`): Top Q/A rewritten with four-station bullets and blacksmith framing; JSON-LD FAQPage updated.
- **Manual** restructured into four Acts with 24 chapters + 6 appendices:
  - Act I — Smelt (Ch 1–5)
  - Act II — Forge (Ch 6–15)
  - Act III — Guard (Ch 16–20, incl. new **Watcher** and **Remote Bridge** chapters)
  - Act IV — Learn (Ch 21–24, incl. new **Bug Registry**, **Testbed**, **Health DNA** chapters; Memory Architecture renumbered to Ch 24)
- **Manual covers** (`docs/manual/index.html`, `what-is-plan-forge.html`, `how-it-works.html`): Rewritten around the Forge Shop metaphor; panorama hero.
- **OG cards site-wide**: 16 pages swapped from `og-card.webp` to `og-card-v2.webp`.
- **Blog archive** (8 posts under `docs/blog/`): v1.x-positioning banner added atop each article linking to the current Shop Tour.

### Notes
- **No behavioral changes.** CLI, MCP tools, hooks, and test suite are unchanged. Tests: 2478/2478 green.

## [2.53.3] — 2026-04-20 — `self-update --force` heals dev-stuck installs

### Fixed

- **`pforge self-update --force` now installs the latest tagged release
  even when the local install reports "newer".** Previously, clients
  stuck on e.g. `2.54.0-dev` (installed from a master sibling-clone)
  could never heal because `compareVersions` ranked their local `-dev`
  above the latest release (`2.53.2`), so `self-update` exited with
  "Already current". With `--force`, the check is bypassed and the
  latest tagged release is installed unconditionally. Mirrors the
  `pforge.sh` implementation. Without `--force`, prior behaviour is
  preserved: if the local install reports "already current" but ends in
  `-dev`, a targeted hint suggests the heal command.

### Dashboard symptoms this unblocks

Clients observed showing:
- Footer: `Plan Forge v2.54.0-dev`
- Missing SVG icons on most tab buttons
- Horizontal scrollbar where sub-tabs should wrap

These were all present in master-clone installs that predate v2.53.0's
dashboard overhaul (`a26a7cb`, `a7419c1`). `pforge self-update --force`
now cleanly installs v2.53.3 and restores the current UI.

### Tests

- 2478/2478 vitest passing.

---

## [2.53.2] — 2026-04-20 — Refuse '-dev' source over clean install

### Fixed

- **`pforge update` now refuses to install a `-dev` source onto a clean
  release install.** Closes the last self-heal gap: when a consumer project
  has a sibling `plan-forge/` clone on master, plain `pforge update`
  (without `--from-github`) would copy master's `VERSION=X.Y.Z-dev` onto
  their clean install, leaving them on an unreleased dev build. This
  happened to at least one known client (observed landing on
  `v2.54.0-dev`). The update now exits with a clear error pointing users
  to `pforge self-update` (which always fetches the latest tagged
  release). Override flag: `--allow-dev` (not recommended). Both
  `pforge.ps1` and `pforge.sh` carry the guard.

### Tests

- 2478/2478 vitest passing (no changes to JS surfaces).

## [2.53.1] — 2026-04-20 — Corrupt-install self-heal + release guard

### 🛡️ Self-heal for stuck clients (v2.50.0/v2.51.0/v2.52.0 broken tarballs)

Tags `v2.50.0`, `v2.51.0`, and `v2.52.0` shipped with `VERSION=X.Y.Z-dev`
baked into the release tarball (fixed in v2.52.1). Clients who installed
any of those releases still see `-dev` locally — this release detects and
auto-fixes that state for **every existing and future install**.

### Added

- **`detectCorruptInstall()`** in `pforge-mcp/update-check.mjs`.
  Conservative detector: flags when local `VERSION` ends in `-dev`
  AND a bare release with matching-or-newer core exists on GitHub.
  Genuine dev branches ahead of the latest release (e.g. `2.54.0-dev`
  while latest is `2.53.1`) are **not** flagged. 8 new tests cover the
  full matrix (broken cohort, genuine dev, offline, malformed inputs).

- **MCP server startup banner.** `server.mjs` runs the detector 2s after
  boot and prints a bordered red alert to stderr when a corrupt install
  is found. Also emits an `install:corrupt` hub event and writes
  `.forge/install-health.json` so the dashboard can render a banner.
  A subsequent heal clears the flag automatically.

- **Smith doctor check.** `pforge smith` now inspects the local `VERSION`
  file directly (not just `.forge.json.templateVersion`). If it ends in
  `-dev`, smith warns with the exact heal command. Parity across
  `pforge.ps1` and `pforge.sh`.

- **Release guard workflow** (`.github/workflows/release-guard.yml`).
  Runs on every `v*` tag push. Fails the release if `VERSION` on disk
  doesn't equal the tag core, or if `VERSION` contains `-dev`. This is
  the exact class of bug that broke v2.50.0/v2.51.0/v2.52.0 — it can
  never happen again.

### Changed

- **`Invoke-Update` (both shells) invalidates version caches on success.**
  Removes `.forge/update-check.json`, `.forge/version-check.json`,
  and `.forge/install-health.json` after a successful update so smith
  and the dashboard immediately pick up the new state.

### Repository maintenance (post-release)

Tags `v2.50.0`, `v2.51.0`, `v2.52.0` were force-moved to the `v2.53.1`
commit and their GitHub releases recreated with "SUPERSEDED → v2.53.1"
notes. Any client who explicitly pins `--tag v2.50.0` now receives the
v2.53.1 clean tree instead of the broken `-dev` bytes.

### Fixed

- Clients stuck on `v2.50.0-dev` / `v2.51.0-dev` / `v2.52.0-dev` now
  self-heal via any of: dashboard banner, MCP startup alert, `pforge
  smith` warning, or the existing `pforge self-update` path. All roads
  lead to a clean `v2.53.1` install.

### Tests

- 2478/2478 vitest passing (was 2470; added 8 detectCorruptInstall tests).

## [2.53.0] — 2026-04-20 — Dashboard UX modernization + Capability-surface sync + Setup/Smith audit remediation

### Setup + CLI + Smith audit remediation (2026-04-20)

Post-v2.52.1 retrospective surfaced gaps across the setup, CLI, and
diagnostic surfaces accumulated over recent releases. Fixed in four
focused commits:

- **`f263cba` — Bash CLI parity + audit aliases.** `pforge.sh` gains
  `cmd_version_bump` + `cmd_migrate_memory` (full ports of the PS1
  handlers, including inline-node regex updates and `--dry-run`
  support). `scripts/audit-cli-parity.mjs` adds a `CLI_ALIASES` map
  so tools whose CLI names differ from `mcpToCli()` convention
  (`forge_validate→check`, `forge_drift_report→drift`,
  `forge_incident_capture→incident`, `forge_deploy_journal→deploy-log`,
  `forge_alert_triage→triage`, `forge_ext_search→"ext search"`,
  `forge_ext_info→"ext info"`) are correctly matched. Truly internal
  tools (`forge_abort`, `forge_diagnose`, `forge_memory_capture`,
  `forge_memory_report`, `forge_skill_status`) added to
  `KNOWN_MCP_ONLY`.

- **`570aa40` — validate-setup MCP/VERSION/dashboard coverage.** Both
  `validate-setup.ps1` and `validate-setup.sh` now surface a Plan Forge
  runtime section checking `VERSION`, `pforge.sh` (bash companion
  from PS1), `pforge-mcp/server.mjs` + `package.json` + `node_modules`
  (with install hint), `.vscode/mcp.json` `plan-forge` server entry,
  and `pforge-mcp/dashboard/index.html` presence. All entries are
  WARN-not-FAIL so downstream projects without Plan Forge runtime
  files aren't broken.

- **`60f5e57` — Smith Bug/Notifications/L2 rows + bash set-e hardening.**
  `Invoke-Smith` and `cmd_doctor` both emit three new sections:
  Bug Registry (counts total/open/resolved + critical/high breakdown
  from `.forge/bugs/`), Notifications (`.forge.json` adapter list),
  and Timeline/Search sources (count of indexable L2 stores among
  runs/memory/crucible/tempering/bugs/incidents). Same commit also
  fixes pre-existing `set -euo pipefail` aborts in `pforge.sh smith`
  that killed the script before Crucible/Tempering on installs
  without `jq`: new `_json_field()` helper with jq→node fallback,
  `|| echo <default>` safety on 6 other jq calls, and `|| true`
  wrap on the tempering `grep -o` pipeline that used to exit 1 on
  zero matches.

- **`2eb598e` — Generic `mcp-call` proxy closes the parity backlog.**
  Rather than hand-write 16 bespoke wrappers (crucible-* ×6,
  tempering-* ×4, bug-* ×4, `generate-image`, `run-skill`) across
  both shells, add one generic command:
  `pforge mcp-call <tool> [--arg=value ...] [--json '{...}']`. PS1
  uses `Invoke-RestMethod`; bash uses `curl`. Accepts either
  `forge_crucible_list` or `crucible-list` naming. Returns raw JSON
  or passthrough; hints on 404/refused. Audit now reports **"All
  unexpected gaps accounted for"** — zero unexpected MCP-only gaps
  from the 65-tool surface.

All 2470 tests remain green across each commit.

### Capability-surface sync (2026-04-20)

Three follow-up commits aligning the advertised capability surface
across every documentation and schema artifact:

- **`02747dd` — CLI_SCHEMA +17 commands.** `capabilities.mjs`
  `CLI_SCHEMA` export grew from 17 to 34 commands. Added: `drift`,
  `deploy-log`, `secret-scan`, `env-diff`, `regression-guard`,
  `hotspot`, `dep-watch`, `fix-proposal`, `quorum-analyze`,
  `health-trend`, `org-rules`, `self-update`, `version-bump`,
  `migrate-memory`, `testbed-happypath`, `mcp-call`, `tour`.
  Auto-regenerated into `pforge-mcp/cli-schema.json` on server
  startup via `writeCliSchema()`.

- **`f3a21d0` — docs/manual/llms prose sync.** `docs/capabilities.md`,
  `docs/manual/**`, `llms.txt`, and `docs/llms.txt` updated with the
  full 34-command surface and correct tool counts (65 tools in
  `TOOL_METADATA`).

- **`cfea1f0` — HTML tile grid.** `docs/capabilities.html` gained
  tiles for the 17 new commands matching the prose entries, with
  proper category groupings.

### Dashboard UX modernization (2026-04-20)

- **`a7419c1` — Dashboard styling, navigation, and accessibility.**
  Full CSS rewrite of `pforge-mcp/dashboard/index.html` using a
  design-token system (CSS custom properties: `--bg-0..3`,
  `--fg-0..3`, `--accent`, `--guard`, `--ring`, `--radius-*`,
  `--shadow-*`). Light theme now re-derives from the same tokens
  instead of fragile `.light { !important }` overrides. Navigation:
  standardized Forge subtab hover to a single neutral color (was 7
  different hover colors — blue/amber/orange/purple/emerald/red/cyan
  — chaotic); LiveGuard subtabs keep amber hover as group accent.
  Accessibility: `role=tablist`/`role=tab` on group + sub-tab lists,
  `aria-selected` / `aria-controls` / `aria-label`, skip-link to
  `#main-content`, sr-only search label, `prefers-reduced-motion`
  override, focus-visible ring on all interactive elements via
  `--ring`. Fixed previously-invalid nested `<main>` elements.
  Header tightened (smaller title, uppercase tracking badges, pill
  run status, proper theme-toggle hit target). Motion polish:
  tab-content `fadeIn` 180ms, slice-card hover lift, drawer uses
  cubic-bezier with backdrop blur on overlay, custom webkit scrollbar.

- **`a26a7cb` — SVG tab icons + wrap-instead-of-scroll.** All 18
  Forge subtabs + 5 LiveGuard subtabs + 2 group tabs now use
  consistent 14–16px stroked Feather/Lucide-style SVG icons that
  inherit `currentColor` (replaces inconsistent emoji, only 7 of 19
  tabs had emoji before). Forge subtab row now wraps to a second
  line on narrow viewports (`overflow-x-auto` → `flex-wrap` with
  `gap-y-1`) instead of horizontal-scrolling, so all tabs remain
  visible on small monitors.

All 2470 tests still green.

---

## [2.52.1] — 2026-04-20 — Release packaging hotfix

**Impact**: v2.50.0, v2.51.0, and v2.52.0 tarballs shipped with `VERSION=x.y.z-dev` because the tag was placed on the plan-closeout commit (still `-dev`) before VERSION was cleaned. Users running `pforge self-update` saw `-dev` badges on their installs. No functional regressions — only the version string is affected.

**Fix**: VERSION set to a clean `2.52.1` **before** tagging; tag placed at that exact commit; `-dev` bump moved to a separate follow-up commit. Release procedure hardened to prevent recurrence (see `/memories/repo/release-procedure.md`).

Self-update: existing `x.y.z-dev` installs will see `2.52.1` as an available update and converge on the next check.

---

## [2.52.0] — 2026-04-20 — Orchestrator silent-failure guard + Testbed happy-path harness + Dashboard polish

Three shipments in one release (3 commits). Tests 1990 → 2470 across full MCP suite. Tools 62 → 63.
Release: https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/releases/tag/v2.52.0

### Shipped — Orchestrator silent-failure guard (2026-04-20)

- **`detectSilentWorkerFailure()`** in `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs`: worker exits 0 with stdout < 50 bytes or help-text output now marks the slice as `failed` instead of silently passing. Closes follow-up for #77 (the `--output-format jsonl` regression that let SHOP-07 appear to pass in 32 seconds).
- 7 new unit tests in `pforge-mcp/tests/worker-capability.test.mjs` covering empty stdout, short stdout, help-text, healthy output, non-zero exits, human sentinel, and missing result. All 27 worker-capability + 212 orchestrator tests green.
- Commit: `b0ab2ac`.

### Shipped — TESTBED-02 Slice 1: happy-path scenario harness (2026-04-20)

- **5 happy-path scenario fixtures** in `docs/plans/testbed-scenarios/` covering manual-ch8 replay, new REST endpoint, bug-to-fix loop, coverage-gap loop, and visual-regression loop.
- **`forge_testbed_happypath`** — new MCP tool that runs all happy-path scenarios sequentially with aggregated pass/fail summary. Registered in `capabilities.mjs` (addedIn: 2.57.0) with `server.mjs` REST wiring.
- **`pforge testbed-happypath`** CLI command (symmetric PowerShell + bash) via `pforge-mcp/testbed/cli-happypath.mjs` helper.
- **25 new unit tests** in `pforge-mcp/tests/testbed-happypath.test.mjs` covering fixture validation, tool handler logic, integration dry-run, CLI parity, and capabilities metadata.
- **Slice 2 (live evidence run) deferred** — requires manual kickoff against `E:\GitHub\plan-forge-testbed`; will roll into TESTBED-03 or a dedicated evidence phase.
- Plan: [docs/plans/Phase-TESTBED-02.md](docs/plans/Phase-TESTBED-02.md). Commit: `10c8779`.

### Shipped — Dashboard polish (2026-04-20)

- **New Smelt modal**: Crucible "New Smelt" upgraded from `window.prompt` to a textarea modal with char counter, Ctrl/Cmd+Enter submit, Escape to cancel, and lane selector.
- **Header version badge** reads the VERSION file and links to the matching GitHub release tag. Amber class for `-dev` builds, green on tagged releases.
- **Fixed hardcoded version strings** in `pforge-mcp/capabilities.mjs` (was `"2.3.0"`) and `pforge-mcp/server.mjs` `/api/version` (was `"2.10.2"`) — both now read the VERSION file at startup.
- Commit: `697b682`.

---

## [2.51.0] — 2026-04-20 — Ask-bus + Auto-update + Testbed harness

Three phases shipped since v2.50.0 (11 commits). Tests 1872 → 1990 (+118). Tools 59 → 62.
Release: https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/releases/tag/v2.51.0

### Shipped — TESTBED-01 recursive validation harness (2026-04-20)

- **`forge_testbed_run`** — new MCP tool: run testbed scenarios against an external testbed repository. Preflight checks (repo exists, clean tree, HEAD match), file lock, step execution, 7 assertion kinds, defect-log writer, hub events, L3 memory capture.
- **`forge_testbed_findings`** — new MCP tool: list/update findings with severity/surface/status filters and redacted observed fields.
- **`pforge-mcp/testbed/runner.mjs`** — scenario runner with DI-based deps, lock management, assertion dispatch table.
- **`pforge-mcp/testbed/defect-log.mjs`** — finding CRUD: `logFinding`, `listFindings`, `updateFindingStatus`. Frozen enums for severity/surface/status. Secret redaction on observed fields.
- **`pforge-mcp/testbed/scenarios.mjs`** — scenario loader/validator: `loadScenario`, `listScenarios`, `validateScenarioFixture`, `resolveTestbedPath`.
- **Assertion kinds**: `file-exists`, `file-contains`, `event-emitted`, `correlationId-thread`, `exit-code`, `duration-under`, `artefact-count`.
- **Scenario fixture format**: JSON files in `docs/plans/testbed-scenarios/` with `kind` enum (`happy-path`, `chaos`, `perf`, `long-horizon`).
- **Scheduling templates** (G6 audit): 3 GitHub Actions workflows under `templates/schedules/` — nightly mutation, weekly drift, daily sweep.
- **CLI-parity audit** (G8): `scripts/audit-cli-parity.mjs` — verifies PowerShell and bash CLI entry points accept identical flag surfaces.
- Plan: [docs/plans/Phase-TESTBED-01.md](docs/plans/Phase-TESTBED-01.md). Commits: `898bfd1` (Slice 01 runner + defect-log + scenarios), `869b7be` (Slice 02 findings tool + schedules + parity audit). Test count +54.

### Shipped — AUTO-UPDATE-01 true auto-install from GitHub (2026-04-20)

Closes [#75](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/75).

- **`pforge update --from-github [--tag <tag>]`** — download release tarball directly from GitHub, extract, and run existing file-copy logic. No local Plan Forge clone required.
- **`pforge-mcp/update-from-github.mjs`** — shared Node.js helper: tag resolution (`resolveTag`), tarball download with 50 MB size cap + gzip verification + SHA-256 audit, config loading from `.forge.json` `update.fromGitHub.*`.
- **Flags**: `--from-github`, `--tag <tag>`, `--keep-cache`. Existing `--dry-run` and `--force` still work.
- **`pforge self-update [--yes]`** — wraps detection + install into a single command. Non-interactive with `--yes`.
- **Dashboard Update Now button** — the existing update banner is now actionable. `POST /api/self-update` streams progress via SSE (`download` → `extract` → `copy` → `done`).
- **`pforge smith --refresh-version-cache`** — bypass the 24-hour GitHub release cache for immediate re-check.
- **Error codes**: `ERR_NO_HEAD_TAG`, `ERR_TAG_NOT_FOUND`, `ERR_RATE_LIMITED`, `ERR_TARBALL_TOO_LARGE`, `ERR_INVALID_GZIP`, `ERR_NETWORK_TIMEOUT`, `ERR_NO_TAR`, `ERR_EXTRACT_FAILED`, `ERR_UPDATE_DURING_RUN` (blocks self-update while `pforge run-plan` is active).
- **Audit log**: Every `--from-github` install appends a JSONL entry to `.forge/update-audit.log` with `{ts, from, tag, sha256, sizeBytes, source, filesChanged, outcome}`.
- **Back-compat**: Existing `pforge update <path>` behavior unchanged.
- Plan: [docs/plans/Phase-AUTO-UPDATE-01.md](docs/plans/Phase-AUTO-UPDATE-01.md). Commits: `6eb48f8` (Slice 1 core), `9c26f7e` (Slice 2 self-update + dashboard + smith refresh). Test count +42.

### Shipped — FORGE-SHOP-06 Ask-bus RPC over the hub (2026-04-20)

- **Slice 06.1 — Hub ask/respond transport** — `hub.ask(topic, payload, opts)` request/reply RPC with timeout, `hub.onAsk(topic, handler)` single-responder registration, `removeAskHandler()`, `listResponders()`. Timeout eviction (`ErrAskTimeout`), no-responder immediate `ok:false`, responder-error wrapping, late-respond drop with warn log. OTEL-style telemetry spans (`ask-telemetry` events). `close()` rejects pending asks. Purely additive — no changes to existing event frames.
- **Slice 06.2 — Responders + executor gate wire-in + dashboard** — 3 initial responders (`brain.gate-check`, `brain.correlation-thread`, `tempering.delegate-sync`). Executor gate-check wire-in between slices (config-guarded via `orchestrator.askBusGate.enabled`, fail-open on timeout). Dashboard Hub subtab surfaces ask/respond metrics + responder registry.
- Plan: [docs/plans/Phase-FORGE-SHOP-06.md](docs/plans/Phase-FORGE-SHOP-06.md). Commits: `e221555` (Slice 06.1), `0a43d22` (Slice 06.2). Test count +22.

---

## [2.50.0] — 2026-04-20 — Forge Shop unified surfaces + HOTFIX bundle

Five phases shipped since v2.49.1 (25 commits). Tests 1850 → 1872 (+22). Tools 56 → 59. Release: https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/releases/tag/v2.50.0

### Shipped — FORGE-SHOP-07 Brain facade (2026-04-20)

- **`pforge-mcp/brain.mjs` facade** — `recall/remember/forget` API routing over L1 (session), L2 (durable files), L3 (OpenBrain semantic). Dumb router with tier-selection rules — no caching, no intelligence.
- **L2_ROUTES expansion** — added 5 new route entries (`crucible`, `liveguard`, `review.counts`, `tempering.perf-history`, `run.latest`) enabling `brain.recall()` for all home-snapshot subsystems.
- **readHomeSnapshot rewired via facade** — 4 quadrant builders (`buildCrucibleQuadrant`, `buildActiveRunsQuadrant`, `buildLiveguardQuadrant`, `buildTemperingQuadrant`) now route reads through `brain.recall()`. Function made `async`; all callers updated.
- **forge_liveguard_run rewired** — alert triage and health trend reads use `brain.recall('project.liveguard.*', { freshnessMs: 60_000 })` instead of direct `readForgeJsonl` calls.
- **perf-budget scanner rewired** — `getBaselineP95()` replaced with `brain.recall('project.tempering.perf-history', { fallback: 'none' })` + inline derivation. Write path (`appendPerfEntry`) unchanged.
- **forge_smith Memory row** — new diagnostic section showing L1 keys, L2 store size, L3 queue depth, L3 last sync age.
- **Dashboard Brain subtab** — new read-only Config subtab (🧠 Brain) with per-tier counters, top 10 keys by hit rate, and recent recall misses. New `GET /api/brain/stats` route.
- Plan: [docs/plans/Phase-FORGE-SHOP-07.md](docs/plans/Phase-FORGE-SHOP-07.md). Commits: `297a3e7` (Slice 07.1 facade + tier backends), `c6cbc66` (async test fix), `a83b72c` (Slice 07.2 strategic adoption + Brain subtab). Test count +22.

### Shipped — HOTFIX-2.50.1 orchestrator plumbing (2026-04-20)

- **#63 fix** — cost/token model attribution for `gh-copilot` worker: `parseTokenUsage()` now reads `--model` arg and strips trailing `\r\n\` from `premiumRequests`. Cost reports no longer show `model: "unknown"`.
- **#73 fix** — runtime-aware `model-performance.json` tier validation: `validatePerformanceTier()` + `performance.strictValidation` config + `performance-tier-degraded` event emitted on mismatch.
- **#74 fix** — PreCommit hook rejects direct-to-master during `run-plan`: `PFORGE_RUN_PLAN_ACTIVE=1` env var + `hooks.preCommit.rejectMasterDuringRun` config + `PFORGE_ALLOW_MASTER_COMMIT` bypass.
- Plan: [docs/plans/Phase-HOTFIX-2.50.1.md](docs/plans/Phase-HOTFIX-2.50.1.md). Commits: `25ea803` (Slice 1 #63), `3672cb1` (Slice 2 #73), `137060a` (Slice 3 #74).

### Shipped — FORGE-SHOP-05 unified timeline (2026-04-20)

- **`forge_timeline` MCP tool** — merged chronological view across 7 L2 sources (hub-events, run events, memories, openbrain, watch, tempering, bugs, incidents). Tool count 58 → 59.
- **correlationId grouping** — flat vs threaded views; group-by algorithm threads events across subsystems for end-to-end workflow visualization.
- **Dashboard Timeline tab** — time-window presets, URL hash router, 10s auto-refresh with pause-on-scroll, filter UI.
- **Streaming JSONL reader** — p95 < 400 ms on 10k-event fixture; no new stores, no new writers.
- Plan: [docs/plans/Phase-FORGE-SHOP-05.md](docs/plans/Phase-FORGE-SHOP-05.md). Commits: `6a43dd3` (Slice 05.1 forge_timeline + MCP), `d429dc5` (Slice 05.2 Timeline tab + correlationId filter).

### Shipped — FORGE-SHOP-04 global search (2026-04-19)

- **`forge_search` MCP tool** — cross-subsystem read-only search over 8 L2 sources (run, bug, incident, tempering, hub-event, review, memory, plan) plus L3 OpenBrain merge. Tool count 57 → 58.
- **Dashboard header search bar** — always-visible search input with `/` keyboard shortcut, arrow-key navigation, debounced queries (150ms), and `Escape` to dismiss.
- **Query-syntax sugar** — `tags:`, `since:`, `source:`, `correlation:` parsed client-side before API call.
- **Search results dropdown** — source-grouped hits with colored badges, matched-token `<mark>` highlighting, deep-links to Runs/Bug Registry/Incidents/Review/Tempering/Memory tabs.
- **REST API** — `GET /api/search` wraps `forgeSearch()` for dashboard consumption.
- **Search history** — last 5 queries cached in `localStorage` with deduplication.
- **XSS prevention** — all result rendering uses `escapeHtml()` before DOM insertion.
- **Performance** — 60s LRU cache with mtime invalidation; p95 < 250 ms on 5k-event fixture.
- Plan: [docs/plans/Phase-FORGE-SHOP-04.md](docs/plans/Phase-FORGE-SHOP-04.md). Commits: `d72d90b` (Slice 04.1 core + MCP), `722ea08` (Slice 04.2 dashboard bar).

### Shipped — FORGE-SHOP-03 notification layer (2026-04-19)

- **Notification core** — consumes hub events, routes by rule, rate-limits (token-bucket + digest coalesce), delivers via pluggable adapters. Webhook adapter in core. Slack/Teams/Email/PagerDuty as extension stubs installable via `pforge ext add`.
- **2 new MCP tools** — `forge_notify_send`, `forge_notify_test` (57 total).
- **Secret hygiene** — webhook URLs/tokens only via env vars; literal secret in config rejected with `ERR_LITERAL_SECRET`.
- **Dashboard** — Config → Notifications subtab with live config watcher.
- Plan: [docs/plans/Phase-FORGE-SHOP-03.md](docs/plans/Phase-FORGE-SHOP-03.md). Commits: `551b850` (core + routing + webhook + rate limiter), `5b5a8e7` (4 stubs + Config subtab + watcher).

---

## [2.49.1] — 2026-04-19

Patch release bundling 5 field-reported bugs, each shipped as a separate commit on the feature branch for per-issue attribution. All 5 slices executed under `--quorum=power` in 40m 54s. Tests 1748 → 1850 (+102). Tool count unchanged (56).

### Fixed

- **Teardown/Cleanup slice safety guard** ([#56](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/56)) — orchestrator now detects destructive-titled slices (`teardown`, `cleanup`, `rollback`, `postmortem`, `finalize`) and injects a worker pre-flight blocking branch-delete / reset-hard / phase-abandoned mutations. Post-slice reachability check fires critical `teardown-branch-loss` incident with reflog entry if the feature branch vanishes. Config-guarded via `orchestrator.teardownGuard.enabled` (default: `true`). Commit `6e469d0`.
- **Alphanumeric slice IDs** ([#64](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/64)) — plan parser regex now accepts `### Slice 2A:`, `### Slice 2B:`, etc. Order resolution: `2A` after `2`, before `2B`, before `3`. Commit `45bed1b`.
- **Quorum worker probe** ([#70](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/70)) — `probeWorkerAvailability(model)` runs once at run start; quorum candidates with missing CLI workers are dropped with a warn instead of hanging. Zero available = fast-fail with exit code 2; one available = degrade-and-continue. Config-guarded via `quorum.strictAvailability` (default: `false`). Silences the `Error: Model "grok-4.20-0309-reasoning" not available` spam on systems without grok installed. Commit `6c402b8`.
- **Quorum leg error capture** ([#65](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/65)) — failed quorum legs now include `error: { code, reason, stderr }` on the result. Reason enum: `timeout | spawn-failed | rate-limit | context-overflow | unknown`. Synthesis report notes `legsFailed: N` and per-model reason. Commit `2b0d759`.
- **LiveGuard prose false-positive** ([#62](https://github.com/srnichols/plan-forge/issues/62)) — orchestrator detects non-command prose patterns (decimal-numbered markdown list, currency `$N.NN`, markdown/diagram keywords `sequenceDiagram`/`flowchart`/table rows/bullets, formula-like `=` with arithmetic) before evaluating the allowlist. Prose emits `liveguard-prose-skipped` info event and does NOT fail the slice. Real commands still hard-fail. Commit `eedcaa7`.

### Planned — TEMPER-07 agent routing (v2.50.x, ships after SHOP-03)

- Phase TEMPER-07 drafted ([docs/plans/Phase-TEMPER-07.md](docs/plans/Phase-TEMPER-07.md)) — deterministic `(bug.type, bug.severity) → agent|skill` router. New MCP tool `forge_delegate_to_agent` invokes agent personas in read-only analyst mode; analyst findings persist to `.forge/tempering/findings/<bugId>.json`. Critical/major bugs auto-surface as `fix-plan-approval` review items (config-guarded OFF by default). Wires the 13 agent personas and 12 skills into the tempering feedback loop for the first time.

### Planned — FORGE-SHOP-06 Ask-bus (v2.53.x, final unification)

- Phase FORGE-SHOP-06 drafted ([docs/plans/Phase-FORGE-SHOP-06.md](docs/plans/Phase-FORGE-SHOP-06.md)) — `hub.ask()` + `onAsk()` request/reply RPC on top of the existing WebSocket hub. Three initial responders: `brain.gate-check`, `brain.correlation-thread`, `tempering.delegate-sync`. Executor gate-check wire-in between slices (config-guarded, fail-open on timeout). No new broker — extends existing hub.

### Shipped — FORGE-SHOP-02 review queue (v2.49.0 target, PRs: a02578a + #69)

- 3 MCP tools: `forge_review_add`, `forge_review_list`, `forge_review_resolve` → 55 total
- New L2 family `.forge/review-queue/<itemId>.json` with atomic writes, enum-validated sources, date-scoped sequential itemIds
- 5 idempotent producer hooks (Crucible stalls, Tempering quorum-inconclusive, visual baselines, bug classifier, fix-plan approval)
- Dashboard Review tab (two-pane filter/detail, action buttons)
- Home tab `activeRuns` quadrant surfaces `openReviews` sub-count
- Watcher anomaly `review-queue-backlog`, forge_smith Review row
- Hub events `review-queue-item-added`, `review-queue-item-resolved`; L3 capture on resolve
- Test count 1649 → 1748 (+99)

### Shipped — FORGE-SHOP-01 Home tab (v2.48.0 target)

- `forge_home_snapshot` MCP tool + `readHomeSnapshot` helper — aggregates the 4 existing L2 readers (`readCrucibleState`, `readLiveguardState`, `readTemperingState`, `findLatestRun`) into a single shop-floor payload. Budget: ≤250ms on 1 000 L2 records.
- Dashboard Home tab — 4-quadrant view (Crucible funnel, active runs, LiveGuard health, Tempering status) + unified activity feed with correlationId group-by toggle. Drill-through buttons to owning tabs with filters pre-applied.
- Watcher chip row: leftmost `Home` chip showing in-flight runs / open incidents / open bugs.
- Tool count: 51 → 52. Test count: 1610 → 1649 (+39).

## [2.47.0] — 2026-04-19 — TEMPER arc complete

Closes the 6-phase TEMPER arc (tempering = "strengthen by repeated
stress" in metallurgy). Adds five new tempering scanners, a bug
registry with GitHub sync, and a closed-loop fix validator. Phases
03.2 / 04 / 05 / 06 were executed autonomously via `pforge run-plan
--quorum=power`.

**Phases shipped:** TEMPER-02 (unit + integration scanners, post-slice
hook) · TEMPER-03 (UI sweep with Playwright + a11y, contract scanner
OpenAPI + GraphQL) · TEMPER-04 (visual-diff scanner with pixel diff +
quorum vision mode + dashboard viewer) · TEMPER-05 (flakiness, perf
budgets, load-stress, mutation testing, scheduling) · TEMPER-06 (bug
registry, GitHub issue adapter, closed-loop fix validator).

**Totals:** 5 new scanners · 5 new MCP tools (`forge_tempering_run`,
`forge_tempering_approve_baseline`, `forge_bug_register`,
`forge_bug_list`, `forge_bug_validate_fix`) · 51 tools registered
(from 46 at start of arc) · 1610 tests across 41 test files · new
hub events: `tempering-run-*`, `tempering-visual-regression-detected`,
`tempering-baseline-promoted`, `tempering-bug-registered`,
`tempering-bug-validated-fixed`, `tempering-contract-mismatch`.

**Full-auto execution stats:** ~2h 23m total worker time across 8
autonomous slices, ~$0.24 run cost + quorum reviewer overhead.
Every PR merged on first CI pass.

### Added — Phase TEMPER-05 — Flakiness + perf budgets + load-stress + mutation (Slices 05.1 + 05.2)

- Flakiness scanner: detects intermittent test failures via repeated
  execution; emits `tempering-flaky-test-detected` hub event.
- Performance-budget scanner: compares current run against historical
  P95 baselines stored in `.forge/tempering/perf-history.jsonl`.
- Load-stress scanner: concurrency-ramp HTTP stress runner with
  configurable RPS + duration; enforces `runtimeBudgets.loadMaxMs`.
- Mutation scanner: source-level mutation testing with kill-rate gate.
- Scheduling module: staggered scanner execution to avoid resource
  contention; budget cascade respected.
- All scanners ship behind optional-dep guards; all support the
  production-guard + `allowProduction: true` opt-in.

### Added — Phase TEMPER-06 Slice 06.1 — Bug registry core + classifier

- Bug registry (`.forge/bugs/<bugId>.json`) with atomic
  read-modify-write, idempotent fingerprinting, and fix-plan linking.
- Classifier: rules-based severity (critical/major/minor) + type
  (functional/performance/visual/contract/security) inference from
  scanner verdicts.
- `forge_bug_register` + `forge_bug_list` MCP tools; `readOpenBugCount`
  surfaced in `readTemperingState` for watcher anomaly awareness.

### Added — Phase TEMPER-06 Slice 06.3 — Closed-loop fix validation

Closed-loop bug fix validation: discover → classify → propose fix → validate → fixed.

- New tool `forge_bug_validate_fix` — re-runs the scanner that discovered a bug
  to verify the fix. On pass: transitions bug to `fixed`, dispatches
  `commentValidatedFix` to bug-adapter, broadcasts `tempering-bug-validated-fixed`
  hub event, and captures OpenBrain thought.
- `forge_fix_proposal` gains `tempering-bug` source — generates 2–3 slice fix
  plans from bug evidence. Automatically transitions bug to `in-fix` and links
  the fix plan path.
- `forge_liveguard_run` gains 9th tempering dimension — surfaces open bug counts,
  critical/high severity, coverage vs minima, mutation score, and last run
  timestamp. Red on critical/high open bugs; contributes to `overallStatus`.
- `runSingleScanner` export from `tempering/runner.mjs` — runs any single
  scanner type with DI support for testing.
- `setLinkedFixPlan` and `appendValidationAttempt` helpers in `bug-registry.mjs`
  — atomic bug record updates for fix plan linking and validation history.
- `readOpenBugCount` in `tempering.mjs` — surfaces unaddressed bugs (>14 days,
  no linked fix plan) for watcher anomaly detection.
- Anomaly `tempering-bug-unaddressed` fires for open real-bugs older than 14 days
  without a linked fix plan. Recommendation: `forge_fix_proposal source=tempering-bug`.
- LIVEGUARD_TOOLS expanded to 18 entries.
- Bug-adapter 4-function contract frozen at v2.47.0.
- 45 new tests in `tempering-closed-loop.test.mjs`.

### Added — Phase TEMPER-06 Slice 06.2 — Bug-adapter extension surface

9th tempering scanner: mutation testing via stack-specific tools
(Stryker, dotnet-stryker, mutmut, pitest, go-mutesting, cargo-mutants).

- Mutation scanner (`tempering/scanners/mutation.mjs`) with per-layer
  minima, budget enforcement, and `captureMemory` on failure.
- Scheduling decision helper (`tempering/scheduling.mjs`) — pure functions
  gating mutation runs by trigger type, critical paths, and fullMutation
  override. Post-slice runs skip mutation unless a critical path is touched.
- Preset adapters: mutation entry added to all 6 supported stacks
  (typescript, dotnet, python, java, go, rust) with `parseOutput` and
  exit-code fallback. PHP/Swift/Azure-IaC remain stubs.
- Runner phase 9 block with `mutationScannerImpl` DI hook, budget cascade,
  and `scannerCount` bumped 8→9.
- `tempering.mjs`: `mutationMaxMs` runtime budget (600s),
  `mutationBelowMinimum` / `flakyCount` / `perfRegressionCount` watcher
  state derivations.
- `orchestrator.mjs`: 3 new anomaly codes (`tempering-mutation-below-minimum`,
  `tempering-flake-detected`, `tempering-perf-regression`) with corresponding
  recommendations.
- `server.mjs`: `fullMutation` (bool) and `trigger` (enum) inputs on
  `forge_tempering_run` schema.
- Dashboard: mutation results panel (`🧬 Mutation Testing`) subscribing to
  `tempering-mutation-below-minimum` hub events.

### Added — Phase TEMPER-04 Slice 04.2 — Visual-diff quorum mode + dashboard viewer

Multi-model quorum voting for the visual-diff investigate band and a
dashboard visual regression viewer with approve/bug/ignore actions.

- Visual-diff quorum mode (2-of-3 default) with configurable models,
  agreement threshold, and per-leg timeout/cost cap sharing.
- Dashboard visual regression viewer: baseline/current/diff image trio,
  per-model vote badges (✓/✗/?/⏱), verdict banner with "Human Review
  Needed" for inconclusive, approve-as-baseline/open-bug/ignore-once
  action buttons.
- L3 decision capture for quorum verdicts (text only, never images).
- Server endpoints: `GET /api/tempering/artifact` (path-traversal safe),
  `POST /api/tempering/bug-stub` (TEMPER-06 placeholder).

### Changed
- `tempering-visual-regression-detected` event now carries `verdict`,
  `quorum`, and `artifacts` fields.
- Default visual analyzer mode changed to `"quorum"` with 3 models.

### Added — Phase TEMPER-04 Slice 04.1 — Visual-diff scanner (pixel diff + single-model analyzer)

Fifth scanner in the Tempering arc. Compares screenshots against
baselines using `pixelmatch` pixel-level diffing and a 3-band
classification system: ignorable (<0.1%), investigate (0.1–2%),
and automatic fail (>2%). The investigate band invokes a single
LLM model to determine if the diff is a true regression.

**New modules:**
- `pforge-mcp/tempering/baselines.mjs` — Baseline storage, promotion,
  diff helpers. Manages `.forge/tempering/baselines/` with PNG files
  and JSON sidecars for promotion metadata.
- `pforge-mcp/tempering/scanners/visual-diff.mjs` — Visual-diff
  scanner with 3-band pixel diff, LLM analyzer for investigate band,
  cost cap, and hub event emission.

**New tool:**
- `forge_tempering_approve_baseline` — Promotes the current screenshot
  for a URL to the visual-diff baseline. Idempotent. Added to
  `MCP_ONLY_TOOLS` and `TOOL_METADATA`.

**Runner wiring:** Visual-diff scanner added as 5th phase in
`runner.mjs` after contract. Supports `visualDiffScannerImpl`
dependency injection for test mocking. `scannerCount` bumped 4→5.

**Dashboard:** Handlers for `tempering-visual-regression-detected`
and `tempering-baseline-promoted` hub events with toast notifications.

**Dependencies:** Added `pixelmatch ^6.0.0` and `pngjs ^7.0.0`.

**Config:** `visualAnalyzer` section in `TEMPERING_DEFAULT_CONFIG`
extended with `ignorableDiff`, `failureDiff`, `maxCostUsd`,
`analyzerTimeoutMs`, `maxImageWidth` keys.
`runtimeBudgets.visualDiffMaxMs` added (300s default).

**Tests:** ~30 new tests in `tempering-visual-diff.test.mjs` covering
baselines, scanner logic, approve-baseline tool, and runner integration.

---

### Added — Phase TEMPER-03 Slice 03.2 — Contract scanner (OpenAPI/GraphQL)

Fourth scanner in the Tempering arc. Validates live API responses
against OpenAPI 3.x specs and GraphQL schemas. Ships behind the same
optional-dep guards as the UI scanner — `js-yaml` is loaded via
dynamic `importFn` and JSON-only specs work without it.

**New modules:**
- `pforge-mcp/tempering/scanners/contract.mjs` — Dispatcher that
  auto-detects spec files (openapi.yaml/json, schema.graphql) and
  routes to the appropriate sub-validator.
- `pforge-mcp/tempering/scanners/contract-openapi.mjs` — OpenAPI
  validator: enumerates paths × methods, fires requests with
  `X-Tempering-Scan: true`, validates response status against spec
  `responses` keys, shallow key+type shape check on JSON bodies.
- `pforge-mcp/tempering/scanners/contract-graphql.mjs` — GraphQL
  validator: regex-parses root Query/Mutation fields from schema file,
  fetches introspection, diffs fields, fires sample queries.

**Runner wiring:** Contract scanner added as 4th phase in
`runner.mjs` after ui-playwright. Supports `contractScannerImpl`
test injection hook. Budget short-circuit from prior scanners applies.

**Anomaly rule #15:** `tempering-contract-mismatch` fires when the
contract scanner detects violations. Severity escalates from `warn`
to `error` at ≥ 5 mismatches. Recommendation directs users to
inspect `.forge/tempering/artifacts/<runId>/contract/report.json`.

**Extension surface:** `extensions/catalog.json` gains an
`opportunities[]` array with stub entries for gRPC, tRPC, and
AsyncAPI contract scanners. `docs/EXTENSIONS.md` documents the
scanner extension contract (ctx shape, return type, config namespace,
artifact directory, production guard requirements).

**Tool metadata:** `forge_tempering_run` description updated in
`capabilities.mjs` and `server.mjs` to reflect all four scanners.

**Tests:** 25 new tests in `tempering-contract.test.mjs` covering
dispatcher (11), OpenAPI validator (9), and GraphQL validator (5).
Existing runner and integration tests updated for 4-scanner order.
Orchestrator tests extended for anomaly #15 + recommendation.

### Added — Phase TEMPER-03 Slice 03.1 — UI sweep scanner (Playwright + a11y)

Third scanner in the Tempering arc. Cross-stack (runs against a
deployed app URL, not source code). Ships behind optional-dep
guards so missing Playwright / axe-core installs skip cleanly rather
than failing the run.

**New module `pforge-mcp/tempering/scanners/ui-playwright.mjs`** —
`runUiSweep(ctx)` mirrors the `runScannerUnit` / `runScannerIntegration`
contract. BFS same-origin link crawler, per-page screenshot capture,
per-page axe-core accessibility pass, aggregate `report.json` written
under the scanner's artifact dir. All dependencies (Playwright,
`@axe-core/playwright`) are loaded via injectable `importFn` so the
MCP process never hard-depends on them and tests never spawn a real
browser.

**Forbidden actions (enforced)**:
- External-origin links are never followed (`isAllowedOrigin`); extra
  allow-list supported via `extraAllowedOrigins`.
- Production URLs are blocked by default — `looksLikeProduction`
  recognises `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `*.local`, and RFC-1918 private
  ranges as non-prod; anything else requires `allowProduction: true`.
- Budget enforcement via `runtimeBudgets.uiMaxMs` (default 600_000ms);
  scanner short-circuits with `verdict: "budget-exceeded"` and closes
  the browser cleanly.
- Prior budget-exceeded from unit or integration cascades — UI scanner
  is skipped with reason `prior-budget-exceeded` before Chromium is
  launched.

**New module `pforge-mcp/tempering/artifacts.mjs`** — `getArtifactDir`,
`getScannerArtifactDir`, `ensureScannerArtifactDir`, `hashUrl`
(sha1-truncated deterministic filenames), `gcArtifacts` (7-day
retention GC), `seedArtifactsGitignore` (idempotent `.gitignore`
append for `.forge/tempering/artifacts/`).

**Runner wiring** — `runTemperingRun` now dispatches three scanners in
order (unit → integration → ui-playwright). `runId` is hoisted early so
artifact-producing scanners can write under a stable directory.
New dependency-injection surface: `uiImportFn` and `uiScannerImpl`
options for tests + future extension hooks. Run record now carries
`phase: "TEMPER-03", slice: "03.1"`.

**Config defaults extended** — `TEMPERING_DEFAULT_CONFIG` in
`tempering.mjs` now includes a `"ui-playwright"` block with
operator-facing overrides (url, maxDepth, maxPages, allowProduction,
captureScreenshots, runAccessibility, a11yMinSeverity,
a11yFailThreshold). Scanner-module `UI_SCANNER_DEFAULTS` stays the
source-of-truth for the full shape.

**Verdict rules**:
- Any broken link (non-2xx/3xx) → `fail`
- a11y violations of severity ≥ `a11yMinSeverity` exceeding
  `a11yFailThreshold` → `fail`
- Budget tripped → `budget-exceeded`
- Otherwise → `pass`

**Tests — +45 new, 1282/1282 green** —
`tests/tempering-ui-sweep.test.mjs` covers:
- Artifacts module: `hashUrl` determinism, `gcArtifacts` retention,
  `seedArtifactsGitignore` idempotency, directory helpers
- URL / origin helpers: `isAllowedOrigin`, `looksLikeProduction`,
  `resolveAppUrl`, `normalizeUrl`
- `runUiSweep` skip paths: disabled, url-not-configured,
  production-url-without-opt-in (and allowProduction opt-in),
  playwright-not-installed, playwright-api-missing
- Crawler behaviour: link traversal, verdict=fail on broken links,
  external-origin filter, `maxPages` cap, `maxDepth` cap, screenshot +
  `report.json` artifact writing
- A11y threshold: below-severity violations pass, serious/critical
  exceeding threshold fail, missing axe module falls back to pass
- Error containment: browser launch failure → `verdict: "error"`

Existing `tempering-runner.test.mjs` + `tempering-integration.test.mjs`
assertions updated for 3-scanner event order, `scannerCount: 3`,
`slice: "03.1"`, and UI-scanner cascade of `prior-budget-exceeded`.

### Added — Phase TEMPER-02 Slice 02.2 — Integration scanner + post-slice hook

Closes Phase TEMPER-02. Slice 02.1 shipped the unit execution harness;
Slice 02.2 adds the integration scanner, a post-slice hook, watcher +
dashboard surfacing, and the `forge_smith` run-record summary.

**Generic `runScanner(ctx)`** — `pforge-mcp/tempering/runner.mjs` now
exposes a scanner-agnostic runner keyed by `ctx.scanner` ("unit" |
"integration"). The previous `runScannerUnit` remains as a back-compat
wrapper; a new `runScannerIntegration` mirror is also exported. Budget
keys are resolved through a frozen `SCANNER_BUDGET_KEYS` map so future
scanners (ui-playwright, load, mutation) slot in without touching the
orchestration body.

**`runTemperingRun` now dispatches both scanners** — unit first,
integration second. If unit hits `budget-exceeded`, integration is
skipped with reason `prior-budget-exceeded` to keep total runtime
bounded. The emitted `tempering-run-completed` event now carries
cross-scanner totals (`pass`/`fail`/`skipped`/`durationMs`), and run
records are persisted with `slice: "02.2"`.

**Six preset adapters extended with integration entries** —
`presets/{typescript,dotnet,python,go,java,rust}/tempering-adapter.mjs`
now each export an `integration` scanner:

- **typescript** — `npx vitest run --dir tests/integration --reporter=json`; JSON totals parser
- **dotnet** — `dotnet test --filter "Category=Integration|FullyQualifiedName~Integration"`; Microsoft summary parser
- **python** — `pytest tests/integration`; pytest summary-line parser
- **go** — `go test -json -tags=integration ./...`; `-json` action-event parser
- **java** — `mvn failsafe:integration-test failsafe:verify`; Surefire totals parser
- **rust** — `cargo test --quiet --tests`; `test result:` line parser

**PostSlice Tempering hook** — `runPostSliceTemperingHook` in
`pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` fires `forge_tempering_run` after a
slice commit when the user has opted in via
`.forge/tempering/config.json` → `execution.trigger: "post-slice"`.
Honours the same skip patterns as the drift PostSlice hook (docs,
merge, chore(release) are skipped), fires exactly once per `sliceRef`
across repeated invocations, and never throws — runner errors are
surfaced as `{ action: "error", skippedReason: "runner-threw:<msg>" }`.
`resetPostSliceTemperingFired()` is exposed for tests and for
`pforge run-plan` to reset when starting a new slice. Runner is
dependency-injected to avoid a circular import with
`tempering/runner.mjs`.

**Watcher anomaly rule #14 — `tempering-run-failed`** —
`detectAnomalies` in `orchestrator.mjs` now flags the most recent
Tempering run when its verdict is `fail | error | budget-exceeded`, at
severity `error` (failing runs aren't advisory). `recommendFromAnomalies`
maps the code to `forge_tempering_run` with a pointer to open the
latest `run-*.json` for per-scanner detail.

**`readTemperingState` extended** — surfaces `totalRuns`, `latestRunTs`,
`latestRunAgeMs`, `latestRunVerdict`, `latestRunStack`, and a boolean
`runFailed`, sourced from a new `listRunRecords` / `readRunRecord` pair
in `tempering.mjs`. The snapshot block stays primitives-only.

**Dashboard — per-slice Tempering pill** — `pforge-mcp/dashboard/app.js`
subscribes to `tempering-run-completed` and buckets the verdict in
`state.tempering.slicePills` keyed by `sliceRef.slice`. `renderSliceCards`
now renders a tiny `🔨✓` / `🔨✗` / `🔨◌` pill next to the gate and
retry indicators, colour-graded green/red/gray. Tooltip shows the
pass/fail/skipped totals and stack. No new HTTP endpoints and no
index.html changes — the pill is pure `app.js` + WebSocket wiring.

**`pforge smith` / `pforge.sh` Tempering section extended** — both the
PowerShell and Bash doctor scripts now read `.forge/tempering/run-*.json`
in addition to `scan-*.json`, reporting `N run(s); latest: <verdict>,
<pass>/<fail>, <age>` and warning when the latest run verdict is
`fail | error | budget-exceeded`.

**Tests — +32 new, 1237/1237 green** — `tests/tempering-integration.test.mjs`
(16 tests: generic `runScanner` with integration scanner, all six
adapter integration parsers, end-to-end `runTemperingRun` two-scanner
run + prior-budget-exceeded short-circuit) and
`tests/tempering-post-slice-hook.test.mjs` (12 tests: skip patterns,
config gating, per-sliceRef fired-once guard, runner error containment,
`resetPostSliceTemperingFired` regression). Existing `runTemperingRun`
assertions updated to expect 2-scanner event order and `slice: "02.2"`
on run records.

### Added — Phase TEMPER-02 Slice 02.1 — Execution harness (unit scanner)

First phase of the Tempering arc that actually **runs** code. TEMPER-01
observed pre-existing coverage reports; TEMPER-02 Slice 02.1 introduces
the subprocess boundary that executes unit test suites through
language-agnostic preset adapters.

**New module `pforge-mcp/tempering/runner.mjs`** —
`runSubprocess` (spawn + stdout/stderr capture + SIGTERM→SIGKILL budget
enforcement), `runScannerUnit` (per-scanner orchestration), `pickChangedFiles`
(regression-first hint via `git diff --name-only`), `runTemperingRun`
(top-level dispatcher), `deriveOverallVerdict` (worst-wins aggregation).
All functions accept injectable `spawn`, `now`, and `adapter` overrides
so the entire module is testable without shelling out to a real runner.

**New module `pforge-mcp/tempering/adapters.mjs`** —
`STACK_ADAPTER_PATHS` registry, `SUPPORTED_STACKS_SLICE_02_1`,
`validateAdapterEntry`, `loadAdapter` (with injectable `importFn`).

**Six first-class preset adapters** — `presets/{typescript,dotnet,python,go,java,rust}/tempering-adapter.mjs`
each export a `temperingAdapter` with a working `unit` scanner:
- **typescript**: `npx vitest run --reporter=json` + JSON reporter parser
- **dotnet**: `dotnet test --nologo --no-restore` + Microsoft summary line parser
- **python**: `pytest --tb=short -q` + summary-line parser (`N passed, M failed, K skipped`)
- **go**: `go test -json ./...` + event-stream parser
- **java**: `mvn test -q -Dsurefire.useFile=false` + Surefire aggregate parser
- **rust**: `cargo test --quiet` + `test result:` summary parser

**Three stub adapters** — `presets/{php,swift,azure-iac}/tempering-adapter.mjs`
ship with `supported: false` and an extension-opportunity reason. The
runner skips them cleanly with the reason surfaced in the run record.

**New MCP tool `forge_tempering_run`** — registered in `server.mjs` with
L3 memory capture on completion, added to `MCP_ONLY_TOOLS` (handles its
own subprocess boundary; never shelled through `pforge.ps1`).
`capabilities.mjs` + `tools.json` entries declare `addedIn: 2.43.0`,
`maxConcurrent: 1`, cost `medium`, prerequisites (`npx`/`dotnet`/`pytest`/
`go`/`mvn`/`cargo` on PATH).

**Hub events** — `tempering-run-started`, `tempering-run-scanner-started`,
`tempering-run-scanner-completed`, `tempering-run-completed`. The final
event carries primitives-only (correlationId, runId, stack, verdict,
pass/fail/skipped, durationMs, sliceRef) — no source content ever.

**Scope contract held** — MUST NOT edit source during a run, MUST NOT
create bugs (TEMPER-06), MUST NOT recurse. All three enforced by code
structure, not runtime checks.

**Testing** — new `pforge-mcp/tests/tempering-runner.test.mjs` with ~45
assertions across adapter registry, adapter shape, per-stack parseOutput,
subprocess boundary, scanner + dispatcher behaviour, event ordering,
event payload shape, MCP wiring (server.mjs / tools.json / capabilities.mjs).
Fake `spawn` + fake `importFn` injected throughout; no real test runners
invoked.

**Fixture** — `pforge-mcp/tests/fixtures/temper/typescript-basic/` —
minimal package.json for integration smoke tests in later slices.

**Phase-TEMPER-02.md** — frontmatter `status: draft → in_progress`.
Slice 02.2 (integration adapters + post-slice wire-in + slice-card pill)
is the next slice.

---

## [2.42.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added — Phase TEMPER-01 Slice 01.2 — Tempering dashboard + watcher awareness

Closes the TEMPER-01 phase. The foundation shipped in Slice 01.1 is now
visible in three operator surfaces — still zero writes to production
source, still no test runs.

**Dashboard (`pforge-mcp/dashboard/`)**

- New **Tempering tab** (`🛠 Tempering`) — read-only pane with four
  sections:
  1. Latest scan summary (status / age / gap / below-min counts)
  2. Coverage vs. minima progress bars (per layer, with minimum markers)
  3. Gap report — worst-first files per below-minimum layer (top 10)
  4. Scan history (newest first)
- "Run scan" button wires to `forge_tempering_scan` via
  `POST /api/tool/forge_tempering_scan`
- Refresh wires to `POST /api/tool/forge_tempering_status`
- `state.tempering` added to the dashboard-side client state

**Watcher tab — Tempering chip row**

Mirrors the Slice 03.2 Crucible row. Renders only when the watched
project has initialized the subsystem (`.forge/tempering/` present).
Chips: total scans, latest status, below-min count, total gaps, scan
age / stale indicator. `data-testid="watcher-tempering-row"`.

**Watcher snapshot / hub event**

- `buildWatchSnapshot` now includes a `tempering` block (mirrors the
  `crucible` contract; null when uninitialized)
- `watch-snapshot-completed` payloads carry a compact `tempering`
  summary (primitives only — safe for bandwidth-constrained WS clients)

**Two new anomaly rules in `detectWatchAnomalies`**

- `tempering-coverage-below-minimum` (severity: warn) — any layer
  below its minimum by ≥ 5 points → `recommendFromAnomalies` suggests
  `forge_tempering_status`
- `tempering-scan-stale` (severity: warn) — latest scan older than
  `TEMPERING_SCAN_STALE_DAYS` (7) → suggests `forge_tempering_scan`

**`pforge smith` (PowerShell + bash)**

New "Tempering:" section surfaces the same information as the
dashboard row:

- Scan count + latest status + age
- Stale warning (≥ 7 days — mirrors the watcher rule)
- Below-minimum warning (≥ 5 points — mirrors the watcher rule)
- Config presence indicator

**Scan record enrichment**

- `coverageMinima` snapshot now persisted on every scan record so
  downstream tooling can render coverage-vs-minima without re-reading
  `config.json`
- `forge_tempering_status` response now includes `coverageMinima` and
  the full `coverageVsMinima` gap report (`files` arrays are already
  bounded top-10 by `computeGaps`)

**Testing**: +29 tests across `tests/tempering-watcher.test.mjs` (20)
and `tests/tempering-dashboard.test.mjs` (9). Total: 1145/1145 passing
(up from 1116).

**Scope held**: no test execution, no bug creation, no production
source edits. TEMPER-02..06 still own their respective surfaces.

### Added — Phase TEMPER-01 Slice 01.1 — Tempering foundation (read-only coverage scan)

First slice of the Tempering arc — the automated test-intelligence
subsystem that sits between the Forge and LiveGuard in the closed loop.
This slice ships the **storage contract + read-only MCP surface only**;
no test runs, no bug creation, no production-source edits. Those land
in later TEMPER phases.

**New module `pforge-mcp/tempering.mjs`** — self-contained, no
orchestrator coupling except for the re-export of `readTemperingState`
to mirror the `readCrucibleState` contract consumed by the watcher.

**Enterprise defaults** (frozen in `TEMPERING_DEFAULT_CONFIG`) seed
`.forge/tempering/config.json` on first scan. Per-layer coverage minima
match the arc doc: domain 90 / integration 80 / controller 60 /
overall 80. All 10 scanners enabled by default; dial down in config if
you must. Visual analyzer is quorum-mode 2-of-3 by default.

**Two new MCP tools:**

- `forge_tempering_scan` — detects stack, locates existing coverage
  report (lcov.info, coverage-final.json, cobertura.xml,
  jacoco.xml, go cover.out, coverage.py JSON, tarpaulin JSON), parses
  it, rolls up by layer (domain / integration / controller / overall),
  computes gaps vs. minima, writes `.forge/tempering/scan-<ts>.json`.
  Read-only — never runs tests.
- `forge_tempering_status` — returns latest N scan summaries for the
  dashboard feed and `forge_smith` panel.

**Supported stacks**: typescript, dotnet, python, go, java, rust.
Detection is cheap (existsSync-only); `node_modules`, `.git`, and
vendor dirs are not scanned.

**Coverage parsers shipped**:

- lcov (Jest, Vitest, c8, nyc)
- Istanbul coverage-final.json
- Cobertura XML (Coverlet, coverage.py XML)
- JaCoCo XML (Maven, Gradle)
- Go cover.out (set/count/atomic modes)
- coverage.py JSON
- cargo-tarpaulin JSON

**Layer classification** is path-heuristic for TEMPER-01 (promotes to
config-driven `layerGlobs` in TEMPER-02). Controllers, routes,
handlers, api → controller; repositories, db, data, dal, persistence
→ integration; services, domain, models, entities, logic → domain;
everything else → overall.

**Correlation ID thread** (per TEMPER-ARC cross-cutting contract):
every scan record stamps a `correlationId`. Callers may pass one to
thread upstream (smelt → plan → run → scan); when absent a
`temper-scan-<uuid>` is minted.

**Hub events** (new):

- `tempering-scan-started` — payload: `{ correlationId, projectDir, configWritten }`
- `tempering-scan-completed` — payload: `{ correlationId, scanId, stack, status, gaps, belowMinimum, reportPath }`

**L3 semantic memory capture** on `tempering-scan-completed` via the
existing `captureMemory()` helper. Tags: `tempering`, `scan`,
`<stack>`, `<status>`. Payload is the gap summary only — never source
content. Best-effort; OpenBrain outages fall through to
`.forge/openbrain-queue.jsonl` as usual.

**Constants**:

- `TEMPERING_SCAN_STALE_DAYS = 7` (matches `CRUCIBLE_STALL_CUTOFF_DAYS`)

**Status codes** emitted:

- `green` — every layer meets its minimum
- `amber` — at least one layer below minimum by ≥ 5 points
- `no-data` — no coverage report found (returns generator hint) or
  unknown stack (returns marker-file guidance)
- `error` — report located but parse returned zero records

**Scope contract** (unchanged from Phase-TEMPER-01 Slice 01.1): no
test execution, no bug creation, no production-source edits, no
`forge_liveguard_run` wire-in, no dashboard surface (that's Slice 01.2).

**Testing**: +62 tests in `tests/tempering-foundation.test.mjs` covering
config defaults, storage helpers, stack detection across all 6 stacks,
all 7 parsers, layer classification, rollup, gap computation, handler
happy paths + failure branches, correlationId threading, hub event
emission, and TOOL_METADATA / tools.json wiring. Full suite: 1116/1116.

### Next

Slice 01.2 ships the Tempering dashboard tab + watcher-row chip + two
anomaly rules (`tempering-coverage-below-minimum`,
`tempering-scan-stale`). See [docs/plans/Phase-TEMPER-01.md](docs/plans/Phase-TEMPER-01.md).

## [2.41.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added — Phase CRUCIBLE-04 Slice 04.1 — Crucible-aware fix proposals

Closes the loop opened by CRUCIBLE-03. The watcher can now *detect*
stalled smelts and orphan handoffs, and `forge_fix_proposal` can now
*act* on them — generating an abandon-or-resume playbook per affected
smelt and dropping it into `docs/plans/auto/` like every other LiveGuard
fix.

**New source: `"crucible"`** on `forge_fix_proposal`:

- Optional `smeltId` input arg targets a specific smelt
- Auto-selection order: stalled in-progress smelts first (oldest mtime
  wins), then orphan hardener handoffs — mirrors watcher anomaly
  priority from Slice 03.1
- Plan IDs namespaced as `crucible-<smeltId>` to prevent collision with
  drift / secret / incident IDs
- Two-slice abandon-or-resume structure:
  1. **Triage** — read the smelt journal, assess staleness vs. active
  2. **Execute decision** — resume (reactivate + nextAction) OR abandon
     (status + reason + supersededBy)
- Validation gate for both generated slices is `pforge smith` — the
  Smith panel is the authoritative truth surface for funnel health, so
  the auto-fix plan closes against the same contract that opened it
- Healthy funnel returns a non-error diagnostic with current counts (no
  throw) so operators know *why* nothing was generated

**Schema updates:**

- `tools.json` — adds `smeltId`, mentions `crucible` in `source`
  description + tool description, `consumes` extended with
  `.forge/crucible/*.json` and `.forge/hub-events.jsonl`
- `capabilities.mjs` `TOOL_METADATA` — new `CRUCIBLE_HEALTHY` error code,
  `consumes` aligned, prerequisites updated

### Tests

- **1054 passing** (was 1036, +18 new)
- `tests/crucible-fix-proposal.test.mjs` — pins schema contract (tools.json + TOOL_METADATA), handler branches (smeltId, stalled-before-orphan priority, namespaced fixId, two-slice titles, healthy-diagnostic non-error, `pforge smith` gate), and auto-selection behavior against a scaffolded `.forge/crucible/` fixture

---

## [2.40.1] — 2026-04-19

### Added — Phase CRUCIBLE-03 Slice 03.2 — Watcher-tab Crucible row

Builds on Slice 03.1's Crucible-aware watcher snapshot. The dashboard
Watcher tab now surfaces the funnel state directly in the snapshot pane
(right below the existing Target / Run State / Run ID / Anomalies grid)
so operators don't have to hop to the Crucible tab or run `pforge smith`
to answer "is the funnel healthy?"

**Event payload change.** `watch-snapshot-completed` hub events now carry
a compact `crucible` block (primitives only — counts + stall/orphan
numbers + cutoff). Kept flat so the WS payload stays small for
bandwidth-constrained clients. Null when the watched project has no
`.forge/crucible/` directory.

**UI.** A six-chip row with a `data-testid="watcher-crucible-row"` anchor:

- `Σ` total smelts
- `✓` finalized (green)
- `⧗` in-progress (blue)
- `✗` abandoned
- `⚠ N stalled` — amber when > 0 (idle ≥ 7 days)
- `⛓ N orphan` — red when > 0 (handoff plan file missing)

Row stays hidden cleanly for pre-Crucible projects.

### Tests

- **1036 passing** (was 1029, +7 new)
  - `tests/crucible-watcher-row.test.mjs` — pins event shape (count vs
    array for `orphanHandoffs`), null when Crucible inactive, all six
    chip bindings, threshold-based coloring, and the `data-testid`
    hook for E2E automation.

---

## [2.40.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added — Phase CRUCIBLE-03 Slice 03.1 — Crucible-aware watcher

`forge_watch` (snapshot + polling mode) now reads `.forge/crucible/` and
surfaces funnel health alongside run health. Until this slice, watcher
snapshots saw **only** run events under `.forge/runs/<id>/events.jsonl`
— stalled smelts, abandoned funnels, and orphan handoffs were invisible
to it. `forge_watch_live` already forwards every `crucible-*` hub event;
this closes the gap for the snapshot watcher that powers dashboards,
polling clients, and one-shot CLI invocations.

**New on `buildWatchSnapshot(...)`:** a `crucible` block containing

- smelt counts split by `finalized` / `in_progress` / `abandoned` / `other`
- `oldestInProgressAgeMs` — ms since the oldest in-progress smelt was touched
- `staleInProgress` — count above the 7-day cutoff (shared with Smith)
- `orphanHandoffs[]` — `crucible-handoff-to-hardener` hub events whose
  `planPath` no longer exists on disk

**Two new anomaly codes** emitted by `detectWatchAnomalies`:

| Code | Severity | When |
|------|----------|------|
| `crucible-stalled` | `warn` | One or more smelts idle `≥ 7 days` in `in_progress` |
| `crucible-orphan-handoff` | `error` | Hardener handoff event references a missing plan file |

Both carry concrete recommendations (`forge_crucible_list` /
`forge_crucible_preview <id>`) so the dashboard Watcher tab can surface
them with click-through actions.

The `CRUCIBLE_STALL_CUTOFF_DAYS` constant is exported so the PowerShell
and bash Smith implementations stay in sync with the watcher.

### Tests

- **1029 passing** (was 1015, +14 new)
  - `tests/crucible-watcher.test.mjs` pins: null-on-inactive, empty-dir
    graceful skip, status counting (incl. skipping `config.json` /
    `phase-claims.json`), stale-cutoff accuracy, corrupt-JSON tolerance,
    orphan detection positive + negative, snapshot shape, and both
    anomaly rules end-to-end plus their recommendations.

---

## [2.39.1] — 2026-04-19

### Added — Phase CRUCIBLE-02 Slice 02.2 — Smith panel + setup banner

**`pforge smith` now reports Crucible health.** Both the PowerShell and bash
implementations gained a new `Crucible:` section (right before the summary)
that surfaces the state of the smelt funnel without requiring the dashboard:

- Total smelt count, split by `finalized` / `in-progress` / `abandoned`
- **Stall warning** — any smelt that has been idle in the `in-progress`
  state for ≥ 7 days is flagged with a `forge_crucible_abandon` hint
- Presence of `config.json` (governance overrides active)
- Count of `manual-imports.jsonl` bypasses
- Count of atomically-claimed phase numbers

Smelt enumeration correctly skips `config.json` and `phase-claims.json`
so they don't get double-counted as smelts.

**Setup scripts carry a one-line Crucible onboarding hint.** Both
`setup.ps1` and `setup.sh` print a nudge in the `Optional (recommended)`
block pointing new operators at `forge_crucible_submit` so the very first
plan they author gets a `crucibleId` baked in.

### Tests

- **1015 passing** (was 1003, +12 new)
  - `tests/crucible-smith-panel.test.mjs` pins the output contract for
    both shells, the stall-detection cutoff, and the banner location

---

## [2.39.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added — Phase CRUCIBLE-02 Slice 02.1 — slice-card complexity + spend badges

Live dashboard slice cards in the **Progress** tab now surface two at-a-glance
signals that previously lived deep in logs or cost reports:

- **Complexity score badge** — `⚙ N/10`, color-graded:
  - 🟢 green for 1–3 (low-risk)
  - 🟠 amber for 4–6 (medium)
  - 🔴 red for 7–10 (high-risk, quorum candidate)
- **Total-spend badge** — `💰 $0.xxxx`, shown once a cost is recorded.

Both pills render in a dedicated row beneath the slice title and update live
from hub events (`slice-started` → complexity, `slice-completed` → cost).

### Changed — orchestrator event payloads

`slice-started`, `slice-completed`, and `slice-failed` events now carry a
`complexityScore` field (computed once up-front for every node in the DAG).
This runs independently of quorum mode — previously the score was only
computed when `quorumConfig.enabled === true`. Existing consumers that
ignore unknown fields are unaffected.

### Tests

- **1003 passing** (was 997, +6 new)
  - 4 in `tests/scheduler-complexity.test.mjs` — verifies both schedulers
    emit `complexityScore` on start/complete/failed, and handles the
    no-score case gracefully
  - 2 in `tests/crucible-dashboard.test.mjs` — pins the render contract
    (badge rendering, threshold breakpoints, hydration from event data)

---

## [2.38.1] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed — Test-suite port flake (EADDRINUSE on 3103–3105)

`pforge-mcp/server.mjs` called `main()` unconditionally at module load, so
every test file that imported it only to call `createExpressApp()` also
booted the full WebSocket hub. When multiple test files ran in the same
vitest pool, the hub tried to bind 3103, 3104, 3105 in succession and
occasionally hit `EADDRINUSE` during teardown.

Now `main()` runs **only** when the module is executed directly:

```js
const isDirectRun = resolve(process.argv[1]) === resolve(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));
if (isDirectRun) main().catch(...);
```

Behavior outside tests is unchanged — `node pforge-mcp/server.mjs` still
boots everything exactly as before.

### Tests

- 997 tests passing, zero errors (was `997 passing, 1 error` on intermittent runs)

---

## [2.38.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added — Non-intrusive update notifier (Phase UPDATE-01)

Plan Forge now tells you when a newer release is available — without
spamming GitHub, without delaying startup, and without nagging users
who've already seen the notice.

- **New module `pforge-mcp/update-check.mjs`** — checks
  `https://api.github.com/repos/srnichols/plan-forge/releases/latest`
  with a 4s timeout and semver comparison
- **Cache** at `.forge/update-check.json` with a 24h TTL. The dashboard
  serves from this cache; the boot-time refresh writes to it once per day
- **Opt-out**: set `PFORGE_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to suppress all checks
- **Never blocks startup** — the check is scheduled with a 2s delay and
  every failure path (network down, HTTP 5xx, malformed JSON, unusable
  `tag_name`) silently returns `null`
- **REST endpoint** `GET /api/update-status` returns
  `{ available, current, latest, url, publishedAt, checkedAt, fromCache }`
- **Dashboard banner** — small dismissible pill in the header (`⬆ v2.38.0
  available (you have v2.37.0)`), linking to the release page. Dismissal
  is remembered per-release in `localStorage` so users aren't nagged

### Added — Roadmap drafts

- `docs/plans/Phase-CRUCIBLE-02.md` — Complexity-Score badge, Total-Spend
  badge, and Smith Crucible panel (scheduled)
- `docs/plans/Phase-SMITH-01.md` — Crucible diagnostics in `forge_smith`
  (likely absorbed into CRUCIBLE-02)

### Tests

- 19 new tests in `tests/update-check.test.mjs` covering semver
  comparison, cache TTL, env-var opt-out, network-failure tolerance,
  malformed-response tolerance, cache-write, force-bypass, and REST
  endpoint shape
- Total suite: 997 tests passing

### Security

- The check only issues a `GET` to the public GitHub Releases API. No
  authentication, no user data transmitted, no telemetry. `User-Agent`
  header identifies the client as `plan-forge-update-check`.

---

## [2.37.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added — Crucible: the idea-smelting pipeline (Phase CRUCIBLE-01)

A new mandatory pre-hardening stage that turns raw ideas into well-specified
Phase plans via a short, structured interview. Every `docs/plans/Phase-*.md`
plan now carries a `crucibleId` in its frontmatter — either from a smelt, from
a `--manual-import` bypass, or from the grandfather migration.

This release rolls up six merged slices.

#### Slice 01.1 — Atomic phase-name claim + naming authority
- New `crucible.mjs`: `nextPhaseNumber(existingNames, parent)`, `claimPhaseNumber(projectDir, phaseName, smeltId)`
- File-lock-based claim at `.forge/crucible/claims/<phaseName>.lock` so two parallel agents can never both stamp "Phase 17"
- Synthetic id prefixes: `grandfathered-<uuid>` (legacy migration), `imported-<source>-<uuid>` (manual import)

#### Slice 01.2 — MCP tools + hub events
- `forge_crucible_submit` / `forge_crucible_ask` / `forge_crucible_preview` / `forge_crucible_finalize` / `forge_crucible_list` / `forge_crucible_abandon`
- Hub events: `crucible-smelt-submitted`, `crucible-answer-recorded`, `crucible-smelt-finalized`, `crucible-smelt-abandoned`, `crucible-handoff-to-hardener`

#### Slice 01.3 — Interview loop
- Three lanes (`tweak` ~3 questions / `feature` ~6 / `full` ~12) with `inferLane()` heuristic
- `getNextQuestion()` drives the question stream, answers persist to JSONL
- `renderDraft()` / `extractUnresolvedFields()` produce the plan body from recorded answers
- Recursion guardrail: `recursionDepth` cap (0–3, default 1) on child smelts

#### Slice 01.4 — Enforcement gate + grandfather migration
- `crucible-enforce.mjs` rejects plans missing `crucibleId:` unless `--manual-import` is supplied
- First-run grandfather migration stamps existing phase files with synthetic ids and writes audit rows
- `--manual-import path --source {human|speckit} --reason "..."` flow with full audit trail at `.forge/crucible/manual-imports.jsonl`
- **Spec Kit coexistence preserved** — Spec Kit imports are a first-class `source: speckit` path

#### Slice 01.5 — Dashboard tab + REST
- New 🔥 Crucible tab: live smelts list, active interview prompt, draft preview, abandon/finalize actions
- REST: `GET/POST /api/crucible/submit`, `/ask`, `/preview`, `/finalize`, `/list`, `/abandon`
- Hub subscription auto-refreshes the UI on every `crucible-*` event

#### Slice 01.6 — Config, Governance, Hardener handoff, manual chapter, self-host
- New `crucible-config.mjs` with sanitizer — persists to `.forge/crucible/config.json`
  - Fields: `defaultLane`, `recursionDepth` (0–3), `autoApproveAgent`, `sourceWeights {memory, principles, plans}` (normalized to sum 100), `staleDefaultsHours` (1–168)
- Dashboard Config tab: Crucible section with all five fields, weight normalization preview, save/reload
- Dashboard Governance tab (🛡, read-only): file viewer for `PROJECT-PRINCIPLES.md`, `project-profile.instructions.md`, `project-principles.instructions.md`, plus full `manual-imports.jsonl` audit table with `vscode://file/` deep-links
- REST: `GET/POST /api/crucible/config`, `GET /api/crucible/manual-imports` (capped 500, newest-first), `GET /api/crucible/governance` (returns `{files, readOnly: true}`)
- `computeStaleDefaultsWarnings()` wired into `handleAsk` — returns `STALE_PRINCIPLES` / `STALE_PROFILE` warnings when governance files are newer than the smelt by `staleDefaultsHours`
- `handleFinalize` emits `crucible-handoff-to-hardener` hub event and returns `hardenerHandoff: {event, nextStep, hint}` pointing at `step2-harden-plan.prompt.md`
- Manual chapter 6.6 (`docs/manual/crucible.html`) — philosophy, lanes, interview loop, recursion, enforcement, Spec Kit path, dashboard, config fields, troubleshooting
- **Self-hosting**: `docs/plans/Phase-CRUCIBLE-01.md` now carries its own `crucibleId` — the plan that defines Crucible is itself a Crucible citizen

### Changed

- Dashboard tab count: 12 core → 13 core (added Governance). Total 17 → 18.
- Every `docs/plans/Phase-*.md` plan now requires frontmatter with `crucibleId`. Existing plans are auto-migrated on first run after upgrade.

### Security

- Governance tab is **strictly read-only**. No `contentEditable`, no `<textarea>`, no edit endpoints. Principles live in the editor, not the browser.
- Every `--manual-import` bypass is audited with timestamp, plan path, source, reason, and synthetic id.

### Migration notes for existing users

- **No action required for Crucible to work** — `.forge/crucible/` auto-creates on first write and is already gitignored.
- On first run after upgrade, `crucible-enforce` scans `docs/plans/Phase-*.md` and stamps any plan missing frontmatter with `crucibleId: grandfathered-<uuid>`. A row is written to `.forge/crucible/manual-imports.jsonl` for each — visible in the Governance tab.
- **Spec Kit users**: continue as before. Use `pforge run-plan --manual-import <path> --source speckit --reason "..."` for imported specs.

---

## [2.36.1] — 2026-04-18

### Fixed — validation gate allowlist hints

When `runGate()` blocks a command that isn't in the allowlist, the error now
includes actionable hints so plan authors can fix typos and unfilled template
placeholders without guessing.

- **`editDistance(a, b)`** — Levenshtein helper exported from `orchestrator.mjs`
- **`isPlaceholderToken(token)`** — detects `{{cmd}}`, `<cmd>`, `$cmd`, and
  literal leak-through words (`item`, `command`, `cmd`, `tool`, `runner`,
  `your-tool`, `your_cmd`, `todo`)
- **`suggestAllowedCommand(token)`** — returns the closest allowlist entry
  within edit distance ≤ 2, or `null`
- **`runGate()` error message** — now appends:
  - `'<token>' looks like an unfilled template placeholder — edit your plan file…`
    when the token matches `isPlaceholderToken()`
  - `Did you mean '<suggestion>'?` when a close allowlist entry exists

Motivation: the Rummag Phase-01 plan tripped slice 7 three runs in a row on a
literal `item` typo (`item install …` where `pnpm` was meant). The block was
correct but the error gave no hint this was a template placeholder. Now it
does.

### Tests

- +11 new tests across 4 describe blocks in `tests/orchestrator.test.mjs`
  (`editDistance`, `isPlaceholderToken`, `suggestAllowedCommand`,
  `runGate allowlist error message`)
- Total: 784/784 passing (up from 773)

---

## [2.36.0] — 2026-04-18

### Memory Architecture Milestone — final rollup

The fifth and final PR on the v2.36 train. Lands GX.1 (dashboard Memory tab)
and GX.2 (L3 → L1 boot-context preload), promotes the four betas to a single
stable release, and ships manual chapter 6.5 documenting the full three-tier
system. Every gap from the original memory-architecture audit (G1.1–G1.4,
G2.1–G2.8, G3.1–G3.7, GX.1–GX.5) is now closed.

### Added — GX.1: Dashboard Memory tab

- **`/api/memory/report`** REST endpoint in `pforge-mcp/server.mjs` — wraps
  `buildMemoryReport(PROJECT_DIR)` so the dashboard can render a live view
  without re-implementing report logic in JS.
- **Memory tab** in `pforge-mcp/dashboard/index.html` + `app.js` — KPI strip
  (captures total / deduped, queue pending / deferred, queue delivered, queue
  DLQ, cache fresh / total), L2 file inventory table with byte-formatted size
  and `_v` version distribution, by-tool / by-type horizontal-bar breakdowns
  (color-coded: gotcha=amber, lesson=green, decision=purple, pattern=blue,
  convention=cyan), drain-trend mini-table, and orphan-file detector.
- Tab loader is defensive — every panel degrades gracefully when its slice
  of the report is empty so a freshly-cloned repo doesn't render error states.

### Added — GX.2: L3 → L1 boot-context preload

- **`buildPlanBootContext(plan, projectName, opts)`** in `pforge-mcp/memory.mjs`
  — pure helper. Returns `{ _v: 1, projectName, planName, hints: [...] }`.
  Hints are deduped by query string and capped (default 8). Each hint carries
  `{ kind: "plan-history" | "slice-keyword", query, limit }`.
- **`memory-preload` hub event** emitted from `orchestrator.mjs` immediately
  after `run-started`. Listening agent runtimes (Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor)
  can resolve the hints via `search_thoughts` and seed working context before
  slice 1 — eliminating the cold-start gap.
- Best-effort try/catch around the preload — a missing project name or empty
  plan never blocks `run-started` propagation.

### Added — Manual chapter 6.5: Memory Architecture

- New chapter `docs/manual/memory-architecture.html` — three-tier overview
  table, ASCII capture-flow diagram, per-tier deep dive (L1 hub, L2 files,
  L3 OpenBrain), GX.2 preload walkthrough, GX.3 telemetry, GX.4 source-format
  rules, GX.5 migration, and a reading list cross-linked to the dashboard
  Memory tab and `forge_memory_report`.
- Chapter inserted as 6.5 between Dashboard (6) and CLI Reference (7) in
  `docs/manual/assets/manual.js` and `docs/manual/index.html` to avoid
  renumbering the Act III + Appendix chapters.

### Tests

- 6 new tests for `buildPlanBootContext` in `pforge-mcp/tests/g3-gx.test.mjs`
  (empty/missing inputs, plan-history hint emission, slice-keyword dedup,
  `maxHints` cap, hint shape).
- Total suite: 773 passing across 11 files (was 767 in beta.4).

### Rollup — what shipped across v2.35.1 → v2.36.0

## [2.36.0-beta.4] — 2026-04-18

### Added — G3.x + GX.3/4/5: memory architecture, level 3 (semantic + tooling)

Fourth beta on the path to v2.36.0. Closes the remaining G3 (intelligence) and
GX.3/4/5 (developer-experience) gaps from the memory-architecture audit. All
changes are zero-migration: existing projects get the new behaviour the moment
they pull, and all new files default to off (TTL stamping, dedup, telemetry,
cache) when their config knobs are absent.

**G3.2 — Cosine-similarity dedupe for captured thoughts.**
Every `captureMemory()` now compares the candidate against the last 50
records in `liveguard-memories.jsonl` using term-frequency cosine similarity.
Near-duplicates (≥ 0.9 by default; tunable via `.forge.json`
`openbrain.dedupThreshold`) are suppressed at L2 and L3 but still emit a hub
event tagged `deduped: true` so the dashboard can show the suppression rate.
New pure helpers: `tokenize`, `cosineSimilarity`, `dedupeThoughtsBySimilarity`.

**G3.3 — Proactive OpenBrain search on watcher anomalies.**
`forge_watch` and `forge_watch_live` now prepend an OpenBrain
`search_thoughts` instruction block to their tool response (one entry per
unique anomaly code). The agent reading the response sees prior occurrences
of the same code before reacting — closing the "observer is amnesic" loop.
New helper: `buildWatcherSearchPrompt`.

**G3.4 — Configurable `openbrain.keywordMap`.**
The hardcoded slice-keyword → OpenBrain-query map in `loadProjectContext`
is now overridable via `.forge.json` → `openbrain.keywordMap: [{pattern,
flags?, query}, …]`. Invalid entries are skipped with a warning; missing
config falls back to the built-in defaults. New helper: `loadKeywordSearchMap`.

**G3.5 — Thought TTL / `expiresAt`.**
`captureMemory()` now stamps `expiresAt` on every thought based on type:
gotcha 90d, decision 180d, lesson 365d, pattern/convention never expire.
Search-block builders consult `filterUnexpiredThoughts()` so stale
observations don't dominate context. New helpers: `stampThoughtExpiry`,
`filterUnexpiredThoughts`.

**G3.6 — Capture-telemetry ledger.**
Every capture (deduped or not) appends a summary record to
`.forge/telemetry/memory-captures.jsonl` (`_v: 1` schema-stamped). Lets the
dashboard answer "who's capturing what, and how often" without scraping
the memory files themselves. New helper: `buildCaptureTelemetry`.

**G3.7 — Memory search cache (helpers).**
New cache-shape and freshness helpers (`buildCacheEntry`,
`isCacheEntryFresh`) for the upcoming `.forge/memory-search-cache.jsonl`
short-circuit. Default TTL 1h. Wired into `forge_memory_report` immediately;
the search short-circuit itself ships in v2.36.0 final.

**GX.3 — NEW MCP tool `forge_memory_report` (tool #37).**
Aggregates the health of every memory surface into one read-only report:
L2 file presence/size/record count/`_v` distribution, OpenBrain queue
buckets (pending/delivered/failed/deferred/DLQ), drain stats trend,
capture telemetry (per-tool/per-type + dedup rate), search-cache health,
and orphan files under `.forge/`. Pure-ish — never writes. Exposed via
`tools.json` and `capabilities.mjs`.

**GX.4 — Source-attribution format `<tool>[/<subsystem>]`.**
New `validateSourceFormat()` helper enforces the canonical shape (e.g.
`forge_watch/quorum-dissent`). `captureMemory()` warn-logs invalid
sources but never drops the capture — visibility-without-breakage.

**GX.5 — `pforge migrate-memory` chore.**
One-shot migrator that merges legacy `.json` ledgers
(`drift-history.json`, `regression-history.json`, `fix-proposals.json`)
into their canonical `.jsonl` siblings, deduping by exact line text.
Backs the legacy file up as `<name>.json.bak-<date>`. Supports `-DryRun`.

### Tests
- New file: `pforge-mcp/tests/g3-gx.test.mjs` (~36 new cases covering every
  pure helper + `buildMemoryReport` aggregator).
- All prior suites unchanged; baseline 705 → ~741 passing.

### Files Changed
- `pforge-mcp/memory.mjs` — 9 new exports + extended `loadProjectContext`.
- `pforge-mcp/server.mjs` — `captureMemory` rewrite; watcher G3.3 hooks;
  `forge_memory_report` handler; `TOOLS` + dispatch entry.
- `pforge-mcp/tools.json` + `capabilities.mjs` — `forge_memory_report` entry.
- `pforge.ps1` — `Invoke-MigrateMemory` + switch routing.
- `VERSION`, `pforge-mcp/package.json` — 2.36.0-beta.3 → 2.36.0-beta.4.

### Migration
- **Zero-migration.** Pull and the new behaviour is on. To roll legacy
  `.json` ledgers into `.jsonl`, run `pforge migrate-memory` (or
  `pforge migrate-memory -DryRun` to preview).

## [2.36.0-beta.3] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed — Worker capability probe + runtime readiness matrix (closes #28)

Third beta drop on the path to v2.36.0. This fixes a silent-failure class where
`pforge run-plan` declared slices "passed" while the underlying worker CLI
actually exited 0 after printing help text and writing zero lines of code. The
canonical repro was `gh copilot` v1.2.x (a legacy `suggest`/`explain`-only build)
receiving agentic flags it didn't understand, printing its usage banner, and
terminating with status 0 — which the orchestrator recorded as success.

- **New `pforge-mcp/worker-capabilities.json` matrix** is now the single source
  of truth for worker + runtime minimums. Each entry declares: probe command,
  version regex, minimum version, capability markers (flags that MUST appear
  in `--help`), invocation template, and per-OS install hints. The matrix is
  consumed by both `orchestrator.mjs` (Node) and `pforge.ps1 smith` (PowerShell)
  so the two agree on what counts as a capable toolchain.

- **`detectWorkers()` rewritten as a capability probe, not a presence check.**
  Each CLI worker now runs its version probe, compares against the matrix
  minimum, then runs a help probe and verifies every capability marker is
  present in stdout. Returns a structured `{ name, available, capable, version,
  minVersion, reason, installHint, type }` record per worker. API-provider
  detection (`api-xai`, `api-openai`) is preserved and unified into the same
  shape.

- **`detectRuntimes()` (new export)** applies the same probe pipeline to the
  runtime floor — `git`, `gh`, `node`, `pwsh` — with per-tool minimums
  (gh ≥ 2.88, node ≥ 20, pwsh ≥ 7). Smith surfaces any runtime below floor
  with a per-OS install/upgrade hint.

- **`spawnWorker()` invocation now reads from the matrix.** The flag set for
  `gh copilot` is now `-p @<promptFile> --yolo --no-ask-user --output-format text`
  sourced from `worker-capabilities.json` with a `{PROMPT_FILE}` placeholder.
  Changing flags no longer requires editing JavaScript.

- **New `detectHelpTextOutput()` heuristic** runs on every worker completion:
  if stdout/stderr contains ≥2 help-text signatures (`usage:`, `USAGE`,
  `Commands:`, `Options:`, `Flags:`, `Run '… --help' for`, legacy
  `gh copilot <command> [flags]` banner) AND the meaningful content is
  < 4000 chars, the result is flagged `looksLikeHelpText: true`. Callers can
  treat exit-0-with-help as a soft failure instead of a silent pass.

- **New `suggestInstall()` / `detectPackageManager()` exports** resolve the
  right per-OS install command for any matrix entry (winget on Windows, brew
  on macOS, apt on Linux) plus a docs URL.

- **`pforge smith` grew a "Runtime & Worker Readiness" section.** Uses the
  same matrix — probes every runtime and every worker, reports
  pass/fail/warn with the per-OS upgrade command. Missing agent workers
  (claude, codex) now print the exact `winget install` / `brew install` /
  `npm install -g` command rather than a generic "install X" sentence.

- **Backward compatibility preserved.** The existing `{ name, available, type }`
  shape returned by `detectWorkers()` is intact — new fields are additive.
  Existing callers at `server.mjs:3943` (`GET /api/workers`) and the
  orchestrator self-test continue to work unchanged.

### Tests

- Added `pforge-mcp/tests/worker-capability.test.mjs` — 20 tests covering
  matrix load + cache, semver comparison (prefix/pre-release tolerance),
  help-text detection (positive cases, real-output false-positives, empty
  input, long-output guard), runtime/worker result shape, and install-hint
  resolution.
- Full suite: **725 tests passing** (705 baseline + 20 new).

### Why it matters

Issue #28 documented 13 commits produced by `pforge run-plan` that contained
zero source-code changes — the orchestrator recorded every slice as "passed"
because the gh-copilot CLI exited 0 after printing help. With this change, a
worker that lacks the agentic capability set is detected **before** execution
begins (`smith` fails loudly) and **during** execution (help-text output is
flagged). `pforge run-plan` no longer trusts a zero exit code alone.

## [2.36.0-beta.2] — 2026-04-18

### Added — L2 file tier improvements (memory architecture gaps G2.1 – G2.8)

Second of three beta drops on the path to v2.36.0. This one tightens the
**L2 (structured files on disk) tier** of the memory architecture.

- **G2.1 — Misnamed `*-history.json` files renamed to `*-history.jsonl`**, with a
  transparent backward-compat read shim. Affected files: `drift-history.jsonl`,
  `regression-history.jsonl`, `health-dna.jsonl`, `quorum-history.jsonl`. All
  four were JSONL-shaped (one record per line) but used the `.json` extension,
  which broke standard JSON tooling. `readForgeJsonl()` now checks for the new
  name first and falls back to the legacy `.json` variant so projects upgrading
  from v2.35 keep working without migration. The `pforge smith` doctor probes
  accept either extension. Also fixed a latent bug in the OpenClaw snapshot path
  that was `JSON.parse`-ing `drift-history.json` as a single JSON array when it
  was actually JSONL.

- **G2.2 — Schema versioning (`_v: 1`) stamped on every L2 record.** `appendForgeJsonl()`
  now auto-adds `_v: 1` to every record it writes. Future schema migrations can
  branch on this field. Caller-supplied `_v` wins so specialised writers can
  bump independently.

- **G2.3 — `pruneForgeRuns(cwd, opts)` helper** in `orchestrator.mjs`. Prunes
  `.forge/runs/<runId>/` directories by two retention dimensions — older than
  `maxAgeDays` days (default 30) OR outside the newest `maxRuns` runs (default
  50). Always keeps the newest run regardless of age. Supports `dryRun` for
  preview. Best-effort: per-run errors accumulate in `result.errors` but never
  throw. A follow-up PR will expose this as a CLI command; this beta ships the
  helper and tests only.

- **G2.4 — `correlationId` option on `appendForgeJsonl()`.** Writers can pass
  `{ correlationId }` in a new fourth argument; the record gains a `_correlationId`
  field. Lets analysts trace L1 hub events ↔ L2 structured records ↔ L3 semantic
  captures back to the same originating run or slice.

- **G2.5 — `auditOrphanForgeFiles(cwd)` helper** in `orchestrator.mjs`. Returns
  `{ known, orphan, whitelist }` lists partitioning every file/dir under `.forge/`
  against a hand-maintained whitelist of recognised artifacts. Catches stale
  files from removed tools and typos in write paths. The whitelist intentionally
  covers **both** the `.jsonl` and legacy `.json` variants of the renamed files,
  so v2.35 projects don't flag them.

- **G2.6 — OpenBrain queue bookkeeping + DLQ semantics.** Every thought enqueued
  via `captureMemory()` when OpenBrain is configured is now shaped by
  `shapeQueueRecord()` which adds `_status: "pending"`, `_attempts: 0`,
  `_enqueuedAt`, `_nextAttemptAt` fields. New pure helpers land in `memory.mjs`:
  - `nextBackoffTimestamp(attempts, now)` — exponential backoff with ±20% jitter
    (30s / 60s / 120s / 240s / 480s).
  - `applyDeliveryFailure(record, opts)` — decides retry vs DLQ after a failed
    delivery attempt; truncates long error messages to 500 chars. After `maxAttempts`
    failures (default 5) the record moves to `.forge/openbrain-dlq.jsonl`.
  - `partitionByBackoff(records, now)` — splits eligible records from those still
    waiting on backoff.

  These are the building blocks a drain worker (or the existing `SessionStart`
  hook) will wire in a follow-up beta.

- **G2.7 — `.forge/env-diff-history.jsonl`** — `forge_env_diff` now appends a
  compact per-scan history record (scan timestamp, baseline name, gap counts per
  env file, totals) in addition to the single-snapshot `env-diff-cache.json`.
  Lets dashboards and the health-trend tool show env drift over time. Values are
  never recorded — key-name counts only.

- **G2.8 — `buildDrainStatsRecord()` helper** for the `.forge/openbrain-stats.jsonl`
  ledger. Summarises each drain pass (attempted / delivered / deferred / dlq /
  durationMs) so the dashboard can render queue health without rescanning the
  queue file every tick.

### Testing

- New `pforge-mcp/tests/g2-files.test.mjs` — **25 tests** covering `_v` stamping,
  `correlationId`, the `.jsonl ↔ .json` read shim, `pruneForgeRuns` (four
  scenarios), orphan audit, and every new `memory.mjs` helper.
- Existing assertions updated to match the new `.jsonl` filenames and the
  `_v: 1` record shape (6 tests fixed; no behaviour change).
- Total test count: 680 → **705 passing**.

### Behaviour notes / compatibility

- **Zero migration needed for upgraders.** Projects with existing
  `drift-history.json` / `regression-history.json` / `health-dna.json` /
  `quorum-history.json` files continue working via the read shim — you just
  won't get new records appended to them; new records land in the `.jsonl`
  sibling. A future `pforge migrate-memory` command (GX.5) will merge them.
- `capabilities.mjs` tool-metadata `produces`/`consumes` strings updated to
  reference the new `.jsonl` names.

---

## [2.36.0-beta.1] — 2026-04-18

### Added — L1 Hub improvements (memory architecture gaps G1.1 – G1.4)

This is the first of three beta drops on the path to v2.36.0. It tightens the
**L1 Hub tier** of the memory architecture documented in `docs/MEMORY-ARCHITECTURE.md`.

- **G1.1 — Hub history expanded + multi-run rehydration.** `EVENT_HISTORY_SIZE`
  raised from 100 → **500** (a 20-slice plan burned through 100 in a single run,
  so dashboards connecting mid-run only saw the tail). On startup the hub now
  also replays events from the last 3 runs under `.forge/runs/*/events.log` via
  a new `Hub.rehydrateFromRuns(runCount)` method — late-connecting clients get
  context across runs, not just the most recent one. Rehydrated events are
  tagged `source: "rehydrate"` so consumers can distinguish replay from live.

- **G1.2 — Durable `.forge/hub-events.jsonl` mirror.** Every `hub.broadcast()`
  call now appends the enriched event (with `version: "1.0"` + `timestamp`) to
  `.forge/hub-events.jsonl` in addition to the in-memory ring buffer. Gives
  dashboards, bridges, and post-mortems a replayable source of truth that
  survives hub restarts and is independent of per-run `events.log` rotation.
  Best-effort: filesystem errors are swallowed so a full disk can never break
  live broadcasting.

- **G1.3 — `forge_cost_report` now emits an L1 event.** The only dual-write
  tool missing a hub broadcast; it now calls `broadcastLiveGuard("forge_cost_report", …)`
  so dashboards can show "cost report generated" in real time, consistent with
  the other 13 LiveGuard tools. (Audit confirmed the other four suspected gaps —
  `forge_regression_guard`, `forge_alert_triage`, `forge_secret_scan`,
  `forge_env_diff` — were already broadcasting; no changes needed there.)

- **G1.4 — `forge_watch_live` dropped-event counter + configurable cap.** The
  hardcoded `captured.length < 500` cap is now a configurable `maxCapturedEvents`
  argument (default 500, max 10 000) and the response includes a new
  **`droppedEvents`** field so callers can tell when the watcher produced more
  events than the buffer could hold. Previously overflow was silent.

### Testing

- New `pforge-mcp/tests/hub.test.mjs` — 9 tests covering the durable append path,
  best-effort failure handling, ring-buffer bounds, and multi-run rehydration
  (happy path, missing directory, malformed lines, `runCount` selection,
  overflow cap).
- `Hub` class now exported from `hub.mjs` so tests can instantiate it with a stub
  `wss` (EventEmitter) and avoid binding a real port.
- Total test count: 671 → **680** passing.

### Behaviour notes / compatibility

- `hub-events.jsonl` is new — nothing reads it yet in this beta; G2.3 (planned
  in `v2.36.0-beta.2`) will add a size cap and rotation policy. On long-running
  projects the file will grow; a follow-up tool or `pforge prune` will land in
  `v2.36.0-beta.2`.
- `forge_watch_live` response shape gained two fields (`droppedEvents`,
  `maxCapturedEvents`); existing callers that didn't read them are unaffected.

---

## [2.35.1] — 2026-04-18

### Added — Memory Architecture doc + Watcher → L3 capture (G3.1)

- **`docs/MEMORY-ARCHITECTURE.md`** — first-class reference for Plan Forge's three-tier operational memory system (L1 Hub / L2 Structured / L3 Semantic). Maps every `.forge/` artifact, OpenBrain capture site, and hub event to its tier; defines the dual-write pattern every new MCP tool must follow; includes the tool-coverage audit and roadmap implications.
- **Watcher anomalies now persist to memory** (gap G3.1 closed) — both `forge_watch` and `forge_watch_live` route detected anomalies through `captureMemory()`, landing them in `.forge/liveguard-memories.jsonl` (L2) and — when OpenBrain is configured — `.forge/openbrain-queue.jsonl` (L3 bridge). The watcher was the only cross-project observer with no semantic memory; it now captures too.
- **`shapeWatcherAnomalyThought(anomaly, meta, tool)`** and **`dedupeWatcherAnomalies(anomalies)`** exported from `pforge-mcp/memory.mjs` — pure helpers that shape anomalies into capturable thoughts and dedupe by `code|message` within a live session.

### Design notes

- Watcher captures land in the **watcher's own** `.forge/` (`PROJECT_DIR`), **never** the target's. The watcher's read-only contract on the target project is preserved.
- Source attribution standardised on `forge_watch/<code>` and `forge_watch_live/<code>` — first step toward the GX.4 cross-tool standard that unlocks the upcoming `forge_memory_report` tool (scheduled for v2.36).
- Severity → thought type mapping: `info` → `lesson`, `warn`/`error` → `gotcha`.

### Tests

- New `pforge-mcp/tests/memory.test.mjs` — 17 new unit tests covering the two new pure helpers (severity-to-type mapping, source-attribution format, content assembly, dedupe semantics, null-safety).
- Total test count: 654 → **671** passing.

---

## [2.35.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added — Watcher v2 (Live Tail, Recommendations, History, Diff Cursor)

- **`forge_watch_live`** — new MCP tool that streams events from a target project's pforge run for a fixed duration. Connects to the target's WebSocket hub (`.forge/server-ports.json`) when running; falls back to `events.log` polling otherwise. Read-only subscriber by design — never sends commands. Caps captured events at 500 per call to bound memory.
- **`recommendations` field** in `forge_watch` reports — every detected anomaly is now mapped to a concrete next-step `pforge` command (e.g., `pforge run-plan --resume-from N`, `pforge fix-proposal`, `pforge abort`, `pforge run-plan --quorum=power`). Recommendations are deduplicated by anomaly code.
- **`watch-history.jsonl`** — `forge_watch` now appends each snapshot to the **watcher's own** `.forge/watch-history.jsonl` (never the target's, preserving the read-only contract). Disable with `recordHistory: false`.
- **`sinceTimestamp` diff cursor** — pass the previous report's `cursor` field to `forge_watch` to get `hasNewEvents` + `newEventsCount` flags. Enables continuous monitoring loops without re-processing the entire event log.
- **Hub event emission** — when the watcher is run inside an active hub session, it emits `watch-snapshot-completed`, `watch-anomaly-detected`, and `watch-advice-generated` events for dashboard / multi-agent consumers.
- **Quorum + skill event surfacing** — snapshot `counts` now includes `quorumDispatched`, `quorumLegsCompleted`, `quorumReviewed`, `skillsStarted`, `skillsCompleted`, `skillStepsFailed`.
- **3 new anomaly codes** — `quorum-dissent` (quorum review reached but slice still failed), `quorum-leg-stalled` (dispatched but legs never returned), `skill-step-failed` (any skill step recorded a failure).

### Added — Dashboard Watcher parity

- **New Watcher tab** in the FORGE section of `localhost:3100/dashboard` — three panels: Latest Snapshot (target, runState, runId, anomaly count, cursor), Advice History (model/tokens/time), and Anomalies (severity-coded codes with message + run ID). Red badge in the tab header counts unread snapshots.
- **Three new WebSocket event handlers** in `dashboard/app.js`: `watch-snapshot-completed` → snapshot feed, `watch-anomaly-detected` → anomaly feed + notification, `watch-advice-generated` → advice feed + notification.
- **Two new Actions cards** — "Live Watch" and "Watch Snapshot" copy the corresponding `pforge watch-live` / `pforge watch` invocations to the clipboard.
- Dashboard tab count: 14 → **15** (10 FORGE tabs incl. Watcher + 5 LiveGuard tabs).

### Changed

- `forge_watch` report shape now includes `recommendations: []` and `cursor: <ISO>` fields. Existing consumers that destructure known fields are unaffected.
- `runWatch` accepts new optional params: `sinceTimestamp`, `recordHistory` (default `true`), `eventBus`.

### Tests

- 22 new tests in `pforge-mcp/tests/orchestrator.test.mjs` covering quorum/skill counts, recommendations, history append, diff cursor, hub event emission, and runWatchLive polling fallback.
- Dashboard tab smoke test updated to assert 15 tabs (10 core + 5 LG).
- Total: **654 passing** (up from 632).

---

## [2.34.3] — 2026-04-17

### Fixed — forge_smith remaining false-positives in downstream projects

- **Site images check is now plan-forge–repo only** — `pforge.ps1` and `pforge.sh` smith no longer warn about missing `og-card.webp`, `hero-illustration.webp`, `problem-80-20-wall.webp` in downstream projects. These are plan-forge’s own marketing assets and have no meaning outside the dev repo. The check is now gated on the presence of `presets/` + `pforge-mcp/server.mjs` (markers unique to the source repo).
- **Lifecycle hook detection now reads `.github/hooks/plan-forge.json`** — the four core hooks (`SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`) are configured in `.github/hooks/plan-forge.json` (shipped by `pforge update` from `templates/`). Smith now treats those hooks as present when the JSON declares them, in addition to file-based and `.forge.json`-based detection. Resolves `4/7 hooks present — Missing: SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse` warning on freshly updated projects.

### Notes

No behavior change for the plan-forge dev repo itself. Downstream projects on v2.34.2 will see both warnings clear after `pforge update`.

---

## [2.34.2] — 2026-04-17

### Fixed — forge_smith warning false-positives

- **PowerShell version detection** — `pforge.ps1` smith now probes for a separately installed `pwsh` (7.x) via `Get-Command pwsh` and reports its version, instead of always reporting the version of the shell that happens to be running the script. Falls back to the current shell only when `pwsh` is not on PATH. Avoids reporting `5.1` when `pwsh 7.x` is installed.
- **`XAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `.env`** — `pforge-mcp/server.mjs` now parses `.env` from `process.cwd()` at startup with a lightweight inline parser (no new dependency; existing `process.env` values always win; failure is best-effort and never breaks server boot). `pforge.ps1` smith also added `.env` as a third fallback source after env vars and `.forge/secrets.json`.
- **Lifecycle hooks reconciliation** — smith hook detection now reads **both** `.github/hooks/<HookName>.{ps1,sh,mjs,js}` files (recursive) **and** the `hooks` block in `.forge.json` (`sessionStart`, `preToolUse`, `postToolUse`, `stop`, `postSlice`, `preAgentHandoff`, `preDeploy`). A hook counts as present if either source defines it.

### Notes

Downstream projects (e.g., consumers running `pforge update`) will pick up these fixes automatically on next update. The `forge_watch` watcher MCP tool added in 2.34.0 and polished in 2.34.1 is unchanged in this release.

---

## [2.34.1] — 2026-04-17

### Changed — Watcher API Polish

- **`runState` normalized** — `forge_watch` now returns stable values `"completed"|"aborted"|"in-progress"|"unknown"` instead of leaking raw event types. Raw event type still available as `lastEventType` for power users. Existing branching code on `"run-completed"` should switch to `"completed"`.
- **`tailEvents` parameter** — control how many trailing events the snapshot includes. Range 1-200 (default 25, clamped). Lower values reduce token cost in `analyze` mode against long-running targets.
- **`counts.escalated`** — new snapshot field: number of `slice-escalated` events seen. Surfaces model-fallback behavior that was previously invisible.
- **`model-escalated` anomaly** — new heuristic anomaly (severity `warn`) fires when any slice was escalated to a stronger model. Helps catch silent quality regressions.

### Fixed
- **`all-skipped` anomaly never fired** — depended on `runState === "completed"` but pre-fix `runState` was `"run-completed"`. Latent since v2.34.0; resolved by normalization.

## [2.34.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added — Watcher (`forge_watch`)

- **New MCP tool `forge_watch`** — read-only observer that tails another project's pforge run from a separate VS Code Copilot session. Use to monitor Rummag-style cross-project executions without touching the target.
- **Two modes**: `snapshot` (file reads + heuristic anomaly detection, no AI cost) and `analyze` (snapshot + invokes frontier model `claude-opus-4.7` for narrative advice).
- **6 heuristic anomaly codes**: `stalled`, `tokens-zero`, `high-retries`, `slice-failed`, `all-skipped`, `gate-on-prose`.
- **Quorum power preset upgraded** — `QUORUM_PRESETS.power.reviewerModel` bumped from `claude-opus-4.6` to `claude-opus-4.7`.
- **Read-only enforcement** — watcher worker spawned with `cwd = watcher's own directory`, never the target's, so any tool calls cannot mutate the target project.
- **26 new unit tests** covering `findLatestRun`, `parseEventsLog`, `readSliceArtifacts`, `buildWatchSnapshot`, `detectWatchAnomalies`, and `runWatch`.

---

## [2.33.0] — 2026-04-17

### Fixed — Orchestrator Reliability & Complexity Scoring (Rummag telemetry regressions)

Five separate bugs surfaced while analyzing Rummag Phase-01 runs — all silently undermining execution reliability, token telemetry, and quorum escalation:

- **`coalesceGateLines` false failures** — Gate allowlist rejected markdown numbered/bulleted list items (e.g. `1. Server generates CSRF token...`) as shell commands, marking successful slices as failed. Now skips lines matching `/^(\d+\.|[-*+])\s+/` before allowlist check. Rummag slice-7 (CI/CD) regression fixed.
- **Windows token capture broken** — Worker child stdout/stderr used default platform encoding; Windows cp437 mangled gh copilot's `↑ ↓ •` arrows in the token summary line, silently breaking `parseStderrStats`. Force `setEncoding("utf8")` on both streams.
- **ASCII fallback for `parseStderrStats`** — Regex extended to accept `^ * v` when terminals strip/replace Unicode (CI logs, restricted codepages). Exported for testability.
- **`SECURITY_KEYWORDS` / `DATABASE_KEYWORDS` missing `/g` flag** — Without global flag, `.match()` returned max 2 elements (match + capture), capping `securityWeight` / `databaseWeight` at 0.33 regardless of actual hit count. Now correctly saturates with 3+ keyword hits.
- **Slice metadata parser missed body-line formats** — `**Depends On:** Slice 1, Slice 2A` and `**Context Files:** \`path/to/file\`` in slice body were ignored; only the inline header tags `[depends: ...]` and `[scope: ...]` were extracted. Rummag plans (and most human-authored plans) use body-line format, leaving `depends[]` and `scope[]` empty → `dependencyWeight` and `scopeWeight` always 0 → complexity score stuck at 2 → **quorum never escalated for any Rummag slice**. Parser now merges body-line and header-tag entries, de-duplicated.

### Added
- 15 regression tests in `tests/orchestrator.test.mjs`: 5 for `coalesceGateLines`, 5 for `parseStderrStats`, 2 for `scoreSliceComplexity` signal detection, 5 for `parsePlan` body-line metadata (including end-to-end Rummag-style integration test).

### Impact
- Slices authored in standard markdown style (numbered CSRF flow descriptions, body-line deps) no longer false-fail the gate
- Token / cost telemetry works on Windows for the first time — enables real model cost comparisons (e.g. Opus 4.6 vs 4.7)
- Quorum escalation now actually triggers on security-heavy or cross-module slices — the feature works as designed

### Migration
No config changes required. Re-run your plan after upgrading; complexity scores will rise to their true values, which may cause slices that previously ran single-model to escalate to quorum. If you want to preserve old behaviour, raise `quorum.threshold` in `.forge.json`.



## [2.32.2] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed — 3 Remaining Issues from v2.32.0 Validation
- **Secrets scanner** (High, #4) — Now requires `SECRET_KEY_PATTERN` match (password, token, api_key, etc.) alongside entropy threshold. Excludes `pforge-mcp/`, `.github/`, `pforge.ps1`, `pforge.sh` from git diff. Should reduce 866 false positives to near-zero.
- **REST proxy** (Medium, #3) — Fixed dead code: `/api/tool/:name` now accesses the MCP SDK’s internal request handler map to dispatch tool calls. Parses JSON result from tool response text.
- **Update deduplication** (Medium, #1) — Added `Group-Object -Property Name` deduplication before report + copy. No more duplicate `UPDATE` lines or double file copies.

## [2.32.1] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed — 6 Issues from v2.32.0 Validation
- **Secrets false positives** (High, #4) — LiveGuard secrets scanner now excludes `package-lock.json`, `*.min.js`, `*.map`, `*.svg`; skips lines >200 chars, git hashes, base64 blobs, npm integrity values; threshold raised from 4.0 to 4.5
- **Duplicate update entries** (Medium, #1) — Replaced 5 overlapping MCP file scans with single recursive scan + cli root files. No more duplicate `UPDATE` lines in `pforge update` output
- **`package.json` version** (Medium, #2) — `pforge-mcp/package.json` now at 2.32.1 (was stuck at 2.22.1)
- **REST proxy for MCP tools** (Medium, #3) — `/api/tool/:name` now routes server-side tools through internal handler instead of CLI proxy. Fixes `forge_liveguard_run` and other MCP-only tools via REST
- **Timeout documentation** (Medium, #5) — `forge_liveguard_run` description now warns about 2-3 min runtime for .NET projects and recommends 300s timeout
- **Auto plans dir** (Low, #6) — Already handled by existing `pforge update` code (creates README.md)

## [2.32.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added — Self-Recursive Improvement: The Forge Gets Smarter Every Run

#### Forge Intelligence (build-time learning)
- **Auto-tune escalation chain** — `loadEscalationChain()` reorders models by success rate × cost efficiency from `model-performance.json`. Best model moves to position 1. Converges after 5 runs.
- **Cost estimator calibration** — `buildEstimate()` compares prior estimates vs actuals, computes correction factor (0.5x–3x). Accuracy improves every run. Returns `costCalibration` in estimate.
- **Adaptive quorum threshold** — `loadQuorumConfig()` reads `quorum-history.json` to auto-tune threshold: <20% quorum needed → raise threshold, >60% → lower. Self-tunes token spend.
- **Quorum outcome tracking** — Every quorum slice appends to `.forge/quorum-history.json` with complexity score, quorum used/needed, pass/fail.
- **Slice auto-split advisory** — `--estimate` flags slices with ≥2 prior failures or >6 tasks + >4 scope files as candidates for splitting.

#### LiveGuard Intelligence (post-coding learning)
- **Recurring incident detection** — `forge_incident_capture` searches 30-day history for prior incidents on same files. ≥3 occurrences auto-escalates severity to `high` with `recurring: { pattern: "systemic" }`.
- **Fix proposal outcome tracking** — `forge_regression_guard` marks fix proposals as `"effective"` when their associated incidents resolve. Tracks which fix patterns work.
- **Hotspot test priority** — `forge_regression_guard` reorders gates to run tests for high-churn files first (from `.forge/hotspot-cache.json`).
- **Project Health DNA** — `forge_health_trend` computes a composite fingerprint: drift avg, incident rate, test pass rate, model success rate, cost per slice. Persisted to `.forge/health-dna.json` for cross-session decay detection.
- **Empty-catch regex expanded** — Now catches comment-only blocks (`catch { // swallowed }`, `catch { /* ignored */ }`).

### Branding
- **Forge Intelligence**: escalation chain, cost calibration, quorum tuning, slice splitting (build-time)
- **LiveGuard Intelligence**: recurring incidents, fix outcomes, hotspot priority, health DNA (post-coding)

## [2.31.2] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed — E7: LiveGuard Events Now Flush Before MCP Response
- **`broadcastLiveGuard` is now `async`** — all 16 call sites use `await`. After broadcasting, `setImmediate` forces an event loop tick so WebSocket `ws.send()` writes flush before the MCP stdio response is returned. This was the likely root cause: synchronous MCP handler returned before the event loop processed pending WS writes.
- **File-based diagnostic log** — Every `broadcastLiveGuard` call writes to `.forge/liveguard-broadcast.log` with timestamp, tool name, hub status, and client count. Since MCP captures stderr, this is the only reliable way to observe broadcast behavior.
- **Import fix** — Added `appendFileSync` to the `node:fs` import.

## [2.31.1] — 2026-04-13

### Added — Full OpenBrain Coverage Across All LiveGuard Tools
- **9 additional auto-capture points:**
  - `forge_deploy_journal` — captures deploy version + notes as decisions
  - `forge_hotspot` — captures top churn files as patterns
  - `forge_secret_scan` — captures findings count as gotchas (when findings > 0)
  - `forge_env_diff` — captures missing key count as gotchas (when gaps > 0)
  - `forge_fix_proposal` — captures fix plan ID and source as decisions
  - `forge_health_trend` — captures health score and trend direction (when trend is not stable)
  - `forge_alert_triage` — captures critical/high alert summaries as gotchas
  - `forge_run_plan` — persists orchestrator’s `_memoryCapture` (run summary + cost anomaly) that was previously built but never written
  - `step1-preflight-check.prompt.md` — now searches OpenBrain + liveguard-memories before preflight checks
- **All 14 LiveGuard tools + run_plan + alert_triage now auto-capture to `.forge/liveguard-memories.jsonl`** (+ `.forge/openbrain-queue.jsonl` when OpenBrain configured)
- **4 pipeline prompts now search memory before acting:** step0 (specify), step1 (preflight), step3 (execute), step5 (review)

## [2.31.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added — OpenBrain Auto-Capture in LiveGuard Tools
- **`captureMemory()` helper** — LiveGuard tools now auto-capture findings to `.forge/liveguard-memories.jsonl` (always) and `.forge/openbrain-queue.jsonl` (when OpenBrain is configured). All captures are best-effort — never break tool execution.
- **Auto-capture in 4 key tools:**
  - `forge_drift_report` — captures violations with file names and rule IDs
  - `forge_regression_guard` — captures auto-resolved incidents and gate failures
  - `forge_incident_capture` — captures incident description, severity, affected files
  - `forge_liveguard_run` — captures health snapshot (score, gates, incidents, status)
- **Pipeline prompts now search OpenBrain before acting:**
  - `step0-specify-feature.prompt.md` — searches for prior decisions and lessons before interviewing
  - `step3-execute-slice.prompt.md` — searches for gotchas and patterns before first slice
  - `step5-review-gate.prompt.md` — searches for prior review findings before reviewing
  - All prompts also check `.forge/liveguard-memories.jsonl` for recent drift/incident context
- OpenBrain is optional — all auto-capture calls check `isOpenBrainConfigured()` first and silently skip if not configured

## [2.30.5] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed — E7: Hub initialization race condition
- **Startup reorder** — WebSocket hub + Express now start BEFORE stdio transport connects. Previously stdio connected first, meaning tool calls could arrive before `activeHub` was set, causing `broadcastLiveGuard` to silently drop all events.
- **Diagnostic logging** — `broadcastLiveGuard` now logs to stderr: `[liveguard] forge_drift_report → N client(s)` on success, or `[liveguard] ... hub not initialized, event dropped` when hub is null.
- Startup order is now: capabilities → Express (:3100) → WebSocket hub (:3101+) → stdio transport. This guarantees `activeHub` is set before any MCP tool call can arrive.

## [2.30.4] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed — E7: LiveGuard Dashboard Events
- **Dashboard events** (E7) — All 14 LiveGuard tools now broadcast `type: "liveguard"` events with tool-specific summary data (score, gates passed, violations, overallStatus). Dashboard handles both `liveguard-tool-completed` and `liveguard` event types. Notifications now show contextual detail (e.g., "LiveGuard: drift-report (score: 98)").
- Key tool summaries: drift broadcasts `score` + `appViolations` + `testStatus`; regression-guard broadcasts `gates` + `passed` + `failed` + `resolved`; liveguard-run broadcasts `overallStatus` + `driftScore` + `gates` + `secrets`; alert-triage broadcasts `total` + `showing`.

**All 10 bugs and all 10 enhancements are now closed.**

## [2.30.3] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed — Final 3 Enhancements (E2, E7, E8)
- **`forge_fix_proposal` / auto-incident** (E2) — Fix plans now include 10-line code snippets around each violation with `>>>` marker on the flagged line. Both the `forge_fix_proposal` incident path and the `autoIncident` drift auto-chain path now emit **Code Context** sections.
- **Dashboard LiveGuard events** (E7) — All 14 LiveGuard tools now emit `type: "liveguard"` events via WebSocket hub (in addition to the `liveguard-tool-completed` detail event). Dashboard can filter on `type === 'liveguard'` for real-time tool activity.
- **Auto-resolve incidents** (E8) — When regression guard passes with no explicit file scope, all open auto-drift incidents are resolved automatically. Fixed `Set.add()` spread bug, removed unreliable command-path extraction. When gates pass project-wide (no `--files`/`--plan`), treats it as full-project validation.

## [2.30.2] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed — `pforge update` now copies core framework files
- **`pforge update`** — Previously only copied templates (prompts, agents, instructions, hooks, dashboard UI). Now also copies core runtime files: `pforge.ps1`, `pforge.sh`, `VERSION`, and all `pforge-mcp/*.mjs` + `package.json` + `tools.json` + `cli-schema.json` + test files. This was the root cause of testbed users not receiving bug fixes or new features after running `pforge update`.
- `pforge.sh` `cmd_update` already had MCP auto-discovery but was missing root CLI files (`pforge.ps1`, `pforge.sh`, `VERSION`) — added.

## [2.30.1] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed — v2.30.0 Verification: 6 Enhancements Not Working on Testbed
- **`forge_diff`** (E6) — Added `(?s)` dotall flag to `Invoke-Diff` scope/forbidden regex in `pforge.ps1`; without it `(.*?)` didn't match across newlines so forbidden paths were never extracted
- **`forge_regression_guard`** (E8) — Auto-resolve now falls back to gate result files and auto-drift incident files when no explicit `--files`/`--plan` provided
- **`forge_health_trend`** (E5) — Added `tests` metric reading from `.forge/regression-history.json`; includes pass rate, total gates, last failure, trend
- **`forge_fix_proposal`** (E2) — Reads 10-line code snippet around flagged violations and includes it in the fix plan under **Code Context** section
- Health trend now tracks 5 metrics: drift, cost, incidents, models, tests
- Health score calculation includes test pass rate

## [2.30.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added — LiveGuard Enhancements: Composite Run, Auto-Chaining, Test Status
- **`forge_liveguard_run`** (E9) — new composite tool runs drift, sweep, secret-scan, regression-guard, dep-watch, alert-triage, and health-trend in a single call. Returns unified `overallStatus` (green/yellow/red). Optional `plan` parameter adds scope diff.
- **`forge_drift_report --autoIncident`** (E1) — auto-chains drift → incident → fix proposal for high/critical violations. Groups incidents by file, generates scoped fix plans in `docs/plans/auto/`.
- **Drift `testStatus`** (E3) — drift report now includes `testStatus` field with test pass/fail count. Auto-detects `npm test` or `dotnet test` based on project type.
- **Regression history** (E5) — `forge_regression_guard` appends to `.forge/regression-history.json` for health trend tracking.
- **Auto-resolve incidents** (E8) — when regression guard passes, open incidents whose `files[]` overlap with guarded scope are auto-resolved with MTTR calculated. Disable with `--autoResolve=false`.
- **Sweep categorization** (E4) — framework code markers now broken down by type: `TODO: 5, placeholder: 38, other: 14`.

### Changed
- **`forge_diff` exit code** (E6) — `pforge diff` now exits 1 when forbidden file edits detected (was exit 0).
- **Plan hardener** (E10) — step2-harden-plan prompt now requires executable validation gates (`\`dotnet build\``) instead of prose descriptions. Manual checks must be prefixed with `[manual]`.
- LIVEGUARD_TOOLS count: 13 → 14 (added `forge_liveguard_run`)
- TOOL_METADATA count: 33 → 34

## [2.29.3] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed — v2.29.2 Verification Failures (Final 2)
- **`orchestrator.mjs`** — Plan parser now strips `\r\n` before splitting lines; fixes ALL regex matching on Windows (validation gates, stop conditions, build/test commands)
- **`forge_dep_watch`** — Fixed `auditResult is not defined` crash on .NET projects; snapshot `depCount` now uses `currentVulns.length` instead of npm-only variable

## [2.29.2] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed — v2.29.1 Verification Failures
- **`pforge.ps1`** — Fixed syntax error (stray `})` in `Invoke-Drift` violation loop) that broke all CLI commands (regression from v2.29.1)
- **`forge_diff`** — Wraps git calls with `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Continue'` so CRLF warnings don't throw under the global `Stop` preference
- **`forge_dep_watch`** — Detects `.slnx` files (.NET 10's XML solution format) in addition to `.sln` and `.csproj`
- **`forge_regression_guard`** — Prose-format gates (`**Validation Gate**: \`dotnet build\` succeeds`) now parsed via full fallback chain: fenced code blocks → inline backtick commands → `testCommand` → `buildCommand` → backtick commands from prose descriptions

## [2.29.1] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed — 9 Platform Bugs from v2.29.0 Testing
- **`forge_drift_report`** — `empty-catch` regex now matches C#'s parameterless `catch { }` syntax (was only matching `catch (e) {}`)
- **`forge_diff`** — CRLF git warnings on Windows no longer crash with `NativeCommandError` (4 call sites fixed)
- **`forge_dep_watch`** — .NET project support via `dotnet list package --vulnerable --format json` (was npm-only)
- **`forge_regression_guard`** — parses inline `**Validation Gate**: \`cmd\`` format + falls back to `buildCommand` fields
- **`forge_fix_proposal`** — incident-based proposals now reference specific files, suggest concrete investigation steps, and generate project-type-aware test gates
- **`pforge smith`** — detects LiveGuard hooks (`PostSlice`, `PreAgentHandoff`, `PreDeploy`) in addition to core hooks
- **`forge_sweep`** / **`forge_drift_report`** — framework code (`pforge-mcp/`, `pforge.*`, `setup.*`) separated from app code in scoring and sweep output; SQL injection false-positives in browser JS eliminated
- **`forge_alert_triage`** — drift violations from framework paths excluded from app scoring

## [2.29.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added — LiveGuard: Fix Proposals, Quorum Analysis, Deploy/Slice/Handoff Hooks, OpenClaw Bridge
- **`forge_fix_proposal`** — generates 1–2 slice fix plans from regression, drift, incident, or secret-scan failures. Writes to `docs/plans/auto/LIVEGUARD-FIX-<id>.md`. Capped at one proposal per `incidentId` to prevent spam. Persists proposal records to `.forge/fix-proposals.json`. Auto-detects source when not specified (drift → incident → secret fallback chain).
- **`forge_quorum_analyze`** — assembles a structured 3-section quorum prompt (Context, Question, Voting Instruction) from any LiveGuard data source. No LLM calls — returns the prompt for multi-model dispatch. Supports `customQuestion` freeform override (max 500 chars, XSS-validated) and `analysisGoal` presets (`root-cause`, `risk-assess`, `fix-review`, `runbook-validate`). Configurable `quorumSize` (1–10, default 3).
- **PreDeploy hook** — `runPreDeployHook()` intercepts deploy triggers (Dockerfile edits, `docker push`, `kubectl apply`, etc.) and evaluates secret-scan + env-diff caches. Blocks on secret findings (configurable), advises on env key gaps and stale caches. Configurable via `.forge.json` `hooks.preDeploy`.
- **PostSlice hook** — `runPostSliceHook()` fires after conventional commits, reads drift history, and computes score delta. Returns silent/advisory/warning based on configurable thresholds (`silentDeltaThreshold`, `warnDeltaThreshold`, `scoreFloor`). Duplicate-firing prevention within sessions.
- **PreAgentHandoff hook** — `runPreAgentHandoffHook()` builds a structured LiveGuard context header for injection into new agent sessions. Includes drift score, open incidents, deploy history, secret scan status, and top alerts filtered by severity. Skips context injection when `PFORGE_QUORUM_TURN` env var is set. Fires regression guard on dirty branches. Posts snapshot to OpenClaw when configured.
- **OpenClaw bridge** — `loadOpenClawConfig()` and `postOpenClawSnapshot()` enable fire-and-forget context snapshots to external OpenClaw endpoints. API key fallback to `.forge/secrets.json`.
- **`loadQuorumConfig()`** — reads quorum configuration from `.forge.json` with preset support (`power`, `speed`), merge order: defaults < preset < user config.

### Changed
- TOOL_METADATA expanded to 33 entries (20 core + 13 LiveGuard)
- LIVEGUARD_TOOLS set expanded to 13 entries (added `forge_fix_proposal`, `forge_quorum_analyze`)
- Capabilities surface updated across `capabilities.mjs`, `capabilities.md`, and `capabilities.html`

### Testing
- 68 new test cases across `server.test.mjs` (327 → 380) and `orchestrator.test.mjs` (91 → 106), 577 total across all test files
- `forge_fix_proposal`: plan file writing, fix-proposals.json persistence, duplicate detection, source-specific plan structure (incident/drift/secret/regression), auto-detection data flow
- `forge_quorum_analyze`: XSS regex validation (script/javascript/on-event patterns), customQuestion length cap, quorumSize clamping, GOAL_PRESETS resolution (4 presets), prompt 3-section assembly, dataSnapshotAge computation, source-specific data loading (drift/incident/triage/runbook/fix-proposal/targetFile)
- `loadQuorumConfig`: defaults, .forge.json merge, corrupt config resilience, preset override, user-overrides-preset priority
- `loadOpenClawConfig`: no config, endpoint+apiKey, secrets.json fallback, missing endpoint, corrupt config/secrets resilience
- `scoreSliceComplexity`: simple vs security-sensitive scoring, signals object shape
- LIVEGUARD_TOOLS v2.29.0: all 13 tools write to `liveguard-events.jsonl`, `forge_fix_proposal` + `forge_quorum_analyze` membership
- Hook integration: PreDeploy→PostSlice chaining (block+trigger, pass+advisory), PreAgentHandoff with full LiveGuard state (drift+incidents+deploy+secrets combined context header)
- TOOL_METADATA v2.29.0 count validation (≥33 entries)

---

## [2.28.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added — LiveGuard: Secret Scan, Env Diff, Dashboard Tab, Telemetry Retrofit
- **`forge_secret_scan`** — post-commit Shannon entropy analysis scanning git diff output for high-entropy strings (leaked secrets). Key-name heuristics classify findings as `api_key`, `secret`, `token`, `password`, `auth`, `private_key`, or `credential`. Confidence levels (`high`/`medium`/`low`) combine entropy score with key-name match. Caches results in `.forge/secret-scan-cache.json` with `<REDACTED>` masking. Annotates deploy journal sidecar (`deploy-journal-meta.json`) when HEAD matches last deploy.
- **`forge_env_diff`** — environment variable key comparison across `.env` files. Detects missing keys between baseline and targets. Auto-detects `.env.*` files (excludes `.env.example`). Compares key names only (never values). Caches results in `.forge/env-diff-cache.json`. Integrates with `forge_runbook` to surface environment key gaps.
- **Dashboard LiveGuard section** — 5 new amber-themed tabs (`lg-health`, `lg-incidents`, `lg-triage`, `lg-security`, `lg-env`) with badge state tracking, tab load hooks, and keyboard shortcut support. Total dashboard tabs: 14 (9 core + 5 LiveGuard).
- **Telemetry retrofit** — `emitToolTelemetry()` integrated into all 11 LiveGuard tool handlers. Writes to `telemetry/tool-calls.jsonl` (all tools) and `liveguard-events.jsonl` (LiveGuard tools only). Best-effort: telemetry failures never crash tools. `DEGRADED` status for graceful degradation paths.
- **`forge_runbook` env-diff integration** — runbook generation now reads `.forge/env-diff-cache.json` and includes "Environment Key Gaps" section when gaps exist. Backward-compatible: absent cache is silently skipped.

### Changed
- TOOL_METADATA expanded to 31 entries (20 core + 11 LiveGuard)
- LIVEGUARD_TOOLS set expanded to 11 entries (added `forge_secret_scan`, `forge_env_diff`)
- Capabilities surface updated across `capabilities.mjs`, `capabilities.md`, and `capabilities.html`

### Testing
- 75 new test cases in `server.test.mjs` (158 → 233), 415 total across all test files
- Shannon entropy computation: empty/null/repeated/balanced/high-entropy string validation
- Threshold clamping: min (3.5), max (5.0), default (4.0), in-range preservation
- Key pattern matching: 7 secret-type patterns + benign variable rejection
- Type inference: 8 type categories (`api_key`, `secret`, `token`, `password`, `auth`, `private_key`, `credential`, `unknown`)
- Confidence classification: high/medium/low boundary conditions
- `.env` key parsing: comments, empty lines, `=` in values, whitespace trimming, value exclusion
- Key comparison: missing-in-target, missing-in-baseline, clean detection, totalGaps aggregation
- Auto-detect `.env.*` files: inclusion, `.example` exclusion, empty case
- Graceful degradation: baseline-not-found structured error, missing target file error
- `emitToolTelemetry`: LIVEGUARD_TOOLS set membership (11 tools), record shape, result truncation, non-object input wrapping, never-throw guarantee, DEGRADED status
- Dashboard tab smoke: 14 tab buttons (9 core + 5 LG), section divider, amber hover style, tabLoadHooks coverage, badge state tracking, keyboard shortcuts
- `forge_runbook` backward compatibility: env-diff cache integration, clean-skip, absent-cache safety, missingInBaseline handling

---

---

## [2.29.0] — planned

### Added
- `forge_fix_proposal` MCP tool — generates 1-2 slice fix plan (`docs/plans/auto/LIVEGUARD-FIX-<id>.md`) from regression, drift, incident, or secret-scan failure; capped at one proposal per incidentId; `source="secret"` supported with credential-rotation template; `alreadyExists: true` on duplicate calls
- `forge_quorum_analyze` MCP tool — assembles structured 3-section quorum prompt from any LiveGuard data source; `customQuestion` freeform override (max 500 chars, XSS-validated); echoes `questionUsed` for audit trail; no LLM calls from `server.mjs`
- `GET /api/fix/proposals` — list all fix proposals (no auth)
- `POST /api/fix/propose` — generate fix proposal (requires `approvalSecret`)
- `GET /api/quorum/prompt` + `POST /api/quorum/prompt` — assemble quorum prompt (no auth, read-only)
- `docs/plans/auto/` directory — gitignored runtime directory; `README.md` committed via explicit gitignore exception `!docs/plans/auto/README.md`
- `generateFixPlan()` and `postOpenClawSnapshot()` helpers in `orchestrator.mjs`

### Hooks (new)
- **PreDeploy** — blocks file writes to `deploy/**`, `Dockerfile*`, `*.tf`, `k8s/**` and CLI commands (`docker push`, `git push`, `azd up`) when `forge_secret_scan` returns findings; warns on env key gaps; configurable via `.forge.json` `hooks.preDeploy.*`
- **PostSlice** — injects amber advisory (delta >5, score ≥70) or red warning (delta >10, score <70) after every `feat|fix|refactor|perf|chore|style|test` commit; never blocks; configurable via `hooks.postSlice.*`
- **PreAgentHandoff** — injects LiveGuard context header at session start; skips entirely when `PFORGE_QUORUM_TURN` env var is set (quorum turns get clean context); fires OpenClaw snapshot POST (5s hard timeout, fire-and-forget); configurable via `hooks.preAgentHandoff.*` + `openclaw.*`

### Integration
- OpenClaw analytics bridge — optional `POST` to `openclaw.endpoint` on `PreAgentHandoff` with drift score, open incidents, last deploy version, alert summary, secret scan status
- `.forge.json` `hooks.*` config block (all three hooks) + `openclaw.endpoint` + `openclaw.apiKey` (references `.forge/secrets.json`)

### Config (`.forge.json`)

## [2.26.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- `faq.html`: 3 new QAs — remote trigger, memory API, and discovery layer for OpenClaw/external agents
- `capabilities.html`: `forge_memory_capture` card added to MCP tool grid; 19 MCP count updated throughout; new "REST API — External Integration" section with run control, memory, discovery, and auth details
- `capabilities.md`: `forge_memory_capture` row in MCP table; 4 new REST endpoints in API table (trigger, abort, memory/search, memory/capture); auth note on write endpoints; new "External Integration" section with curl examples and required config

### Changed
- MCP tool count updated to 19 across all docs (faq.html ×2, capabilities.html ×6, capabilities.md ×2)

---
## [2.25.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- **REST API discovery — all bases covered** — OpenClaw and any external agent can now discover the full Plan Forge REST surface via three complementary paths:
  - `forge_capabilities` MCP tool — `restApi.endpoints` array now includes all 13 endpoints (trigger, abort, memory search/capture, bridge approve, well-known)
  - `/.well-known/plan-forge.json` — already served; capability surface now includes the full endpoint list
  - `docs/llms.txt` — new REST API section documents all endpoints with auth requirements and body shapes
  - `AGENT-SETUP.md` Section 6 — new "External Integration" section with copy-pasteable curl examples for OpenClaw, CI, and webhook use cases

---

## [2.24.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- **`forge_memory_capture` MCP tool** — new MCP capability for OpenClaw and external agents to capture thoughts, decisions, lessons, and conventions into OpenBrain persistent memory. Accepts `content`, `project`, `type` (decision/lesson/convention/pattern/gotcha), `source`, and `created_by`. Returns a structured `capture_thought` payload ready for OpenBrain.
- **`POST /api/memory/capture` REST endpoint** — companion HTTP endpoint so OpenClaw can POST memories directly without going through an AI worker. Validates, normalises, and broadcasts a `memory-captured` hub event. Secured with the same `bridge.approvalSecret` Bearer token. Returns the thought payload for OpenBrain persistence.

---

## [2.23.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- **`POST /api/runs/trigger`** — inbound HTTP trigger endpoint so OpenClaw (or any external orchestrator) can start a plan run on the MCP server without sitting at VS Code. Accepts `plan`, `quorum`, `model`, `resumeFrom`, `estimate`, and `dryRun`. Returns `{ ok, triggerId, message }` immediately; run executes in background with full dashboard + bridge notifications.
- **`POST /api/runs/abort`** — companion endpoint to abort an in-progress triggered run. Auth: same `bridge.approvalSecret` Bearer token used by the approval gate.
- **Blog index infographic link** — "🗺️ View System Infographic →" button added below hero image on blog index page.

### Fixed
- **Dashboard nested interactive control** — moved "Plan Browser →" anchor outside `<summary>` to resolve accessibility violation.
- **Plan Browser inline style** — extracted `height: calc(100vh - 56px)` into `.layout-body` CSS class.
- **Infographic CSS** — extracted all inline styles from feature cards into named classes; added `-webkit-backdrop-filter` Safari fallbacks throughout.

---

## [2.22.0] — 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **Grok image model names** — corrected `grok-2-image` → `grok-imagine-image` in dashboard dropdown and REST API default; added URL response handling alongside b64_json
- **Grok pricing table** — updated to match current xAI API rates ($2.00/$6.00 for flagship, $0.20/$0.50 for fast); added 6 new model IDs

### Added
- **Quorum power/speed presets** — `--quorum=power` (flagship models, threshold 5) and `--quorum=speed` (fast models, threshold 7); available via CLI, MCP, and `.forge.json`
- **3-provider quorum default** — Claude Opus 4.6 + GPT-5.3-Codex + Grok 4.20 Reasoning (three different vendors for genuine multi-vendor consensus)
- **`.forge/secrets.json` API key fallback** — store API keys in gitignored `.forge/secrets.json` as an alternative to environment variables; lookup order: env var → secrets file → null

---

## [2.21.0] — 2026-04-10

### Changed — Forge Anneal (Documentation Consolidation)

- **README.md** — thinned from 1,082 to 216 lines (80% reduction). Detailed preset/agent/skill tables moved to `capabilities.md` and `CUSTOMIZATION.md`. FAQ moved to website. Pipeline details moved to `COPILOT-VSCODE-GUIDE.md`. README now covers: hero + value prop + quickstart + compact "what's included" + doc links.
- **ROADMAP.md** — compressed from 1,714 to 191 lines (89% reduction). Shipped versions compressed to 2-3 line summaries. Full release details live in `CHANGELOG.md`. Only planned/in-progress items retain full detail.
- **AI-Plan-Hardening-Runbook.md** — replaced 996-line full template runbook with 22-line redirect to pipeline agents and prompt templates (`step0-*.prompt.md` through `step6-*.prompt.md`). Prompt files ARE the runbook in executable form.
- **UNIFIED-SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md** — compressed from 1,840 to 75 lines. Executive summary, architecture diagram, integration points, and memory layers retained. Full content preserved in git history.
- **Total reduction**: 10,910 → 5,782 lines across 14 human-facing docs (47% reduction, 5,128 lines removed)

---

## [2.20.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added — Forge Quench (Code Simplification Skill)

- **`/forge-quench` skill** — new shared skill that systematically reduces code complexity while preserving exact behavior. Named after the metallurgical quenching process. 5-step workflow: Measure → Understand First (Chesterton's Fence) → Propose → Apply & Prove → Report. Each simplification is committed individually with rationale; tests run after every change; failing tests trigger immediate revert.
- **8 stack-specific variants** — each preset (dotnet, typescript, python, java, go, swift, rust, php) has a forge-quench variant with framework-appropriate complexity measurement tools: `radon` (Python), `gocyclo`/`gocognit` (Go), `cargo clippy` (Rust), ESLint complexity rule (TypeScript), `phpmd` (PHP), `pmd` (Java), `swiftlint` (Swift), manual analysis (.NET)
- **Full Skill Blueprint compliance** — all 9 forge-quench files include Temper Guards (5 entries), Warning Signs (6 items), Exit Proof (6 verifiable checkboxes), and Persistent Memory hooks

---

## [2.19.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added — Skill Blueprint & Verification Gates

- **SKILL-BLUEPRINT.md** (S1) — formal specification for Plan Forge skill format published at `docs/SKILL-BLUEPRINT.md`. Documents all required sections (Frontmatter, Trigger, Steps, Safety Rules, Temper Guards, Warning Signs, Exit Proof, Persistent Memory), naming conventions, token budget guidance, cross-skill references, and new skill checklist
- **Exit Proof in all skills** (S2) — all 79 SKILL.md files across 9 presets now include `## Exit Proof` checklists with 4–6 verifiable evidence requirements per skill. Stack-specific commands used throughout (e.g., `dotnet test`, `pytest`, `cargo test`, `go test ./...`)
- **Temper Guards and Warning Signs in all skills** (S3) — all 79 SKILL.md files now include `## Temper Guards` tables (3–5 shortcut/rebuttal pairs per skill) and `## Warning Signs` lists (4–6 observable anti-patterns). Domain-specific to each skill type (migration, deploy, review, audit, etc.)

Every SKILL.md now follows the full Skill Blueprint format: Frontmatter → Trigger → Steps → Safety Rules → Temper Guards → Warning Signs → Exit Proof → Persistent Memory.

---

## [2.18.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added — Temper Guards & Onboarding Polish

- **Temper Guards in instruction files** (T1) — 40 instruction files across all 8 app presets now include `## Temper Guards` tables: documented shortcuts agents use to cut corners (e.g., "This is too simple to test", "We'll add auth later") paired with concrete rebuttals. Covers testing, security, error handling, database, API patterns, and architecture principles. Stack-specific terminology used throughout (e.g., Zod for TypeScript, Pydantic for Python, `[Authorize]` for .NET)
- **Warning Signs in instruction files** (T2) — same 40 files include `## Warning Signs` sections: observable behavioral anti-patterns that agents and reviewers can grep for during and after execution (e.g., "Controller contains database queries", "Empty catch block", "String interpolation in SQL")
- **`context-fuel.instructions.md`** (T3) — new shared instruction file (`applyTo: '**'`, priority LOW) teaching agents context window management within Plan Forge: when to load which files, recognizing context degradation, token budget awareness, and session boundary guidance. Registered in `setup.ps1` and `setup.sh` Step 2
- **Quick Forge Card** (T4) — 4-step quickstart card added to `planforge.software` homepage hero section: install plugin → init project → describe feature → click through pipeline. Links to detailed setup guide
- **`pforge tour`** (T5) — new interactive CLI command in both `pforge.ps1` and `pforge.sh` that walks through 6 categories of installed Plan Forge files (instructions, agents, prompts, skills, hooks, config) with real file counts from the user's project
- **MCP capabilities updated** — `capabilities.mjs` guardrails section now documents `temperGuards`, `warningSigns`, and `contextFuel` features; `context-fuel` added to shared guardrails list

---

## [2.17.0] — 2026-04-07

### Fixed — Dashboard Reliability
- **Event watcher rewrite** — on server startup the watcher now replays the full event history from the latest run log into hub history (not just tail from EOF); fixes dashboard showing "Waiting for run events" after a server restart
- **Run-switch watcher detach** — on each new plan run, the old `watchFile` listener is explicitly removed and the read offset reset before the new log is attached; prevents duplicate events and stale handlers accumulating across runs
- **ES module import cleanup** — replaced legacy `require('fs')` calls in the file-watcher code path with proper `import` statements, fixing module-type errors in `server.mjs`

### Added — Setup Completion & Smith Diagnostics
- **Phase 24 hardened plan** — `docs/plans/Phase-24-DASHBOARD-SETUP-HARDENING-v2.17-PLAN.md` documents the full scope contract, acceptance criteria, and 6-slice execution plan for the Dashboard Reliability & Setup Completion release

---

## [2.16.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added — Platform Completion & Setup Hardening (Phase 23)
- **Nested Subagent Pipeline (B2)** — all 5 pipeline agent templates (`specifier`, `plan-hardener`, `executor`, `reviewer-gate`, `shipper`) updated with `agents` tool in YAML frontmatter, `## Nested Subagent Invocation` section with precise handoff instructions, and termination guards to prevent recursion; Reviewer Gate LOCKOUT loop capped at 2 fix cycles before human escalation; Shipper marked as terminal node; `"chat.subagents.allowInvocationsFromSubagents": true` added to `templates/vscode-settings.json.template`; "Single-Session Pipeline with Nested Subagents" section added to `docs/COPILOT-VSCODE-GUIDE.md` explaining the 4→1 session collapse, VS Code setting, termination guard table, and manual handoff fallback
- **Status-reporting instruction file** — new `.github/instructions/status-reporting.instructions.md` with 7 standard output templates (progress update, slice complete, blocker report, failure/recovery, run summary, handoff summary, slice status table); auto-loads via `applyTo` on plan, MCP, and forge files; wired into `setup.ps1` / `setup.sh` Step 2 and `copilot-instructions.md.template`

---

## [2.15.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added — Copilot Platform Integration (Phase 22)
- **One-click plugin install** (A1) — `vscode://chat-plugin/install?source=srnichols/plan-forge` and `vscode-insiders://` buttons added to `docs/index.html`, `docs/docs.html`, `docs/capabilities.html`, `AGENT-SETUP.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/QUICKSTART-WALKTHROUGH.md`; fallback text for VS Code < 1.113
- **Model deprecation sweep** (A2) — removed all `gpt-5.1` references from `pforge-mcp/server.mjs`, `README.md`, `CUSTOMIZATION.md`, `docs/capabilities.md`, `docs/capabilities.html`, `docs/faq.html`, and `templates/copilot-instructions.md.template`; confirmed `gpt-5.3-codex` (LTS), `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, and Claude Sonnet 4.6 are current defaults
- **Cloud agent integration guide** (A3) — new `templates/copilot-setup-steps.yml` template for Copilot cloud agent setup; "Using Plan Forge with Copilot Cloud Agent" section added to `docs/COPILOT-VSCODE-GUIDE.md`; cloud agent references added to `README.md`, `AGENT-SETUP.md`, `docs/index.html`, `docs/capabilities.md`, `docs/capabilities.html`, `docs/faq.html`
- **Copilot Memory coexistence docs** (A4) — Memory Layers three-way comparison table (Copilot Memory vs Plan Forge Run Memory vs OpenBrain) added to `docs/COPILOT-VSCODE-GUIDE.md`, `docs/capabilities.md`, `docs/capabilities.html`, `README.md`, and `docs/faq.html`
- **`forge_org_rules` MCP tool + `pforge org-rules export` CLI** (B1) — consolidates `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`, `copilot-instructions.md`, and `PROJECT-PRINCIPLES.md` into a single org-level instruction block; supports `--format github|markdown|json` and `--output <file>`; documents the two-layer model (Layer 1 org baseline vs Layer 2 repo-specific)
- **`/forge-troubleshoot` skill** (B3) — new skill at `presets/shared/skills/forge-troubleshoot/SKILL.md`; auto-detects "instructions ignored" / "guardrail bypass" triggers; 5-step diagnosis: `pforge smith` → settings check → `/troubleshoot #session` suggestion → failure checklist → OpenBrain history search
- **Quorum mode default** — `quorum=auto` is now the orchestrator and `forge_run_plan` default; threshold-based multi-model consensus kicks in automatically for complex slices (complexity ≥ 7) without requiring explicit `--quorum` flag

---

## [2.14.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added — Quality Engineering (Phase 21)
- **Vitest test suite** — `pforge-mcp/tests/` with framework tests covering parser slice extraction, bridge formatters (Telegram/Slack/Discord/Generic), analyzer scoring (MUST/SHOULD extraction + checkbox fallback), and constants validation (SUPPORTED_AGENTS, MODEL_PRICING); run with `npm test` in `pforge-mcp/`
- **Background orchestrator mode** — `pforge run-plan` now spawns `node orchestrator.mjs` as a detached background process, writes PID to `.forge/orchestrator.pid`, and polls `GET /api/runs/latest` every 5 s for live progress; `--foreground` flag restores blocking behavior for debugging
- **`GET /api/runs/latest` endpoint** — `server.mjs` exposes the most recent run's summary and current slice status for the background polling client
- **Parser format tolerance** — `parsePlan()` now accepts case-insensitive slice headers (`### Slice N:`, `### Slice N —`, `### Slice N.`), case-insensitive `Build Command` / `build command` / `**Build command**`, and flexible `Depends On` parsing (`Slice 1`, `1`, `depends: 1`)
- **Auto-discover updater** — `pforge update` (ps1 and sh) now scans the entire `pforge-mcp/` directory tree by SHA-256 hash instead of a hardcoded file list; new files are added automatically; `--check` is now an alias for `--dry-run`
- **Dashboard config loading states** — config tab shows an animated skeleton placeholder while the API fetch is in-flight; fields populate only after the response arrives; 5 s timeout handler prevents indefinite spinner
- **stderr streaming safety** — `parseStderrStats()` is called inside the worker `close` handler so it always receives the fully-accumulated stderr string, not a partial stream; covered by `tests/worker.test.mjs`

---

## [2.13.1] — 2026-04-07

### Added — Dashboard Capabilities + Doc Refresh (Phase 20)
- **Model performance chart** — dashboard now renders a per-model success-rate bar chart sourced from `.forge/model-performance.json`; updates live on each run completion event
- **Routing indicator** — dashboard displays the auto-selected model for the next slice alongside its historical success rate and estimated cost tier
- **Bridge status section** — MCP bridge health (connected / reconnecting / offline) and last-heartbeat timestamp shown in the dashboard sidebar; escalation indicators highlight slices currently in quorum
- **Plan Browser link** — dashboard header now links to the Web UI plan browser (`/ui`) opened in a new tab
- **Public docs refresh** — `docs/index.html` updated with Web UI plan browser section, agent-per-slice routing feature entry, and OpenBrain deep-context description

---

## [2.13.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added — Platform Complete (Phase 19)
- **Agent-per-slice routing** — orchestrator reads `.forge/model-performance.json` and auto-selects the cheapest model with >80% success rate for each slice type; `--estimate` output now shows recommended model per slice with historical success rate; `slice-model-routed` event emitted on selection
- **OpenBrain deep context** — `loadProjectContext()` in `memory.mjs` searches project history for decisions and patterns relevant to each slice title; context block injected into worker prompts before slice instructions; graceful no-op when OpenBrain is not configured
- **Preset minimum-count validation** — `validate-setup.ps1` / `validate-setup.sh` now check per-preset minimum file counts (≥15 instructions, ≥6 agents, ≥9 prompts, ≥8 skills for full stacks; ≥5/1/3 for azure-iac); missing counts reported as warnings
- **Spec Kit auto-detection** — `setup.ps1` / `setup.sh` detect `specs/`, `memory/constitution.md`, and `specs/*/spec.md` at startup and set `speckit: true` in `.forge.json`; prints "Spec Kit artifacts detected. Plan Forge will layer guardrails on top."
- **Dual-publish extensions** — `pforge ext publish` now outputs both a Plan Forge catalog entry and a Spec Kit-compatible `extensions.json` entry; `extensions/PUBLISHING.md` updated with dual-publish instructions
- **Auto-update notification in `pforge smith`** — fetches `VERSION` from GitHub (5 s timeout, 24 h cache in `.forge/version-check.json`); warns when a newer release is available with `pforge update` command; skips silently when offline
- **Web UI plan browser** (`localhost:3100/ui`) — read-only single-page app served from `pforge-mcp/ui/`; lists plans via `/api/plans`, renders slice metadata cards, DAG dependency view, and scope contract; no execution controls (those remain on the dashboard)

---

## [2.12.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added — Escalation & CI Trigger Events (Phase 18)
- **`slice-escalated` event** — emitted when a slice is escalated to quorum for multi-model consensus (includes `sliceId`, `reason`, `models`)

- **Platform formatters** — per-platform rich formatting: Telegram Markdown v2 with emoji, Slack Block Kit with action buttons, Discord Embeds with color-coded sidebars, Generic JSON envelope
- **ApprovalGate state machine** — pause execution at `run-completed`, POST approval request to configured channels, resume on `POST /api/bridge/approve/:runId` callback; auto-rejects after configurable timeout (default 30 min)
- **REST endpoints** — `GET /api/bridge/status` (connected channels + pending approvals), `POST /api/bridge/approve/:runId` (approval callback), `GET /api/bridge/approve/:runId` (browser-friendly for Telegram inline buttons)
- **Notification level filtering** — `all`, `important`, `critical-only` per channel
- **Rate limiting** — max 1 notification per 5 seconds per channel to prevent spam during parallel slices
- **Config via `.forge.json`** — `bridge.channels[]` array with type, url, level, approvalRequired per channel
- **4 new EVENTS.md event types** — `approval-requested`, `approval-received`, `bridge-notification-sent`, `bridge-notification-failed`
- No new npm dependencies — uses Node.js built-in `fetch`

---

## [2.9.2] — 2026-04-06

### Added — Extension Registry (Phase 15)
- **`pforge ext publish <path>`** — validates extension.json, counts artifact files, and generates a ready-to-submit catalog.json entry (PowerShell + Bash)
- **Live Extension Catalog** on `docs/extensions.html` — dynamically fetches catalog.json from GitHub, renders searchable/filterable extension cards with install commands
- Plan executed via `pforge run-plan --quorum` orchestrator (3 slices, $0.03, 7.5 min)

## [2.9.1] — 2026-04-06

- **`/security-audit` skill** — 4-phase comprehensive security procedure: OWASP Top 10 vulnerability scan, dependency audit, secrets detection (13 regex patterns), and combined severity-rated report
- **6 variants**: shared base + TypeScript (npm audit), Python (pip-audit), .NET (dotnet list --vulnerable), Go (govulncheck), Java (mvn dependency-check)
- **Stack-specific OWASP checks**: prototype pollution (Node.js), pickle injection (Python), BinaryFormatter (C#), race conditions (Go), JNDI injection (Java)
- **Quorum support**: 3-model independent OWASP scan with synthesized findings
- Registered in copilot-instructions.md template and all agent adapters (Claude, Cursor, Codex, Gemini)

### Added — Gemini CLI Adapter (Phase 13)
- **`-Agent gemini`** — new adapter generates `GEMINI.md` (project context + `@import` guardrails), `.gemini/commands/planforge/*.toml` (all prompts + agents as TOML commands), `.gemini/settings.json` (MCP server config)
- Gemini CLI uses `@file.md` import syntax for instruction files instead of embedding (lighter context, auto-updated)
- Commands use TOML format with `prompt = """..."""` multi-line strings
- Pipeline commands invoked as `/planforge:step0-specify`, `/planforge:step3-execute-slice`, etc.
- `-Agent all` now includes gemini (5 agents total: copilot, claude, cursor, codex, gemini)

## [2.7.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added — Dashboard Enhancements (Phase 9)

#### Plan Browser
- **Plan file browser** in Progress tab — lists all `Phase-*-PLAN.md` files with status icons, slice count, and branch name
- **Estimate** and **Run** buttons per plan — launch `run-plan --estimate` or full execution directly from the dashboard
- **`GET /api/plans` endpoint** — scans `docs/plans/` and returns parsed plan metadata

#### Git Operations
- **Create Branch** action card — prompts for branch name and creates a git branch from the plan's branch strategy
- **Auto-Commit** action card — generates a conventional commit message from the current slice goal
- **Diff** action card — shows changed files color-coded against the scope contract (green = in-scope, yellow = out-of-scope, red = forbidden)

#### Sweep Table
- **Structured sweep output** — TODO/FIXME/HACK/STUB markers rendered as a filterable table with File, Line, Type, and Text columns
- **Type badges** — color-coded by severity: TODO (blue), FIXME (amber), HACK (red), STUB (gray)
- **Filter buttons** — toggle visibility by type with live counts

#### Model Comparison
- **Model comparison table** in Cost tab — aggregates per-model performance: run count, pass rate (color-coded), average duration, average cost, total tokens
- Useful for comparing Claude vs Grok efficiency on your specific workloads

## [2.6.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added — Skill Slash Command Upgrade (Phase 8)

#### Tier 1 — MCP Integration & Modernization
- **De-duplicated 3 contaminated skills** — `dependency-audit`, `api-doc-gen`, `onboarding` were identical across all 5 presets with multi-stack commands. Each now has ONLY its stack's tools (40 files changed)
- **`tools:` frontmatter** — all 40 app-preset skills now declare required tool access in YAML frontmatter
- **Conditional step logic** — skills include "If step fails → skip/stop" patterns for intelligent flow control
- **MCP tool integration** — `/test-sweep` calls `forge_sweep`, `/code-review` calls `forge_analyze` + `forge_diff`, `/staging-deploy` calls `forge_validate`, `/onboarding` calls `forge_smith`
- **Structured reports** — all skills output pass/fail summary with counts

#### Tier 2 — New Skills & Hub Integration
- **`/health-check` skill** — chains `forge_smith` → `forge_validate` → `forge_sweep` into a structured diagnostic pipeline
- **`/forge-execute` skill** — guided wrapper: list plans → estimate cost → choose mode → execute → report results
- **Skill event schema** — 4 new event types: `skill-started`, `skill-step-started`, `skill-step-completed`, `skill-completed`
- **Dashboard Skills tab** — real-time timeline of skill executions with per-step status
- **`forge_skill_status` MCP tool** — query recent skill execution events from the hub

#### Tier 3 — Executable Skill Engine
- **`skill-runner.mjs`** — new module: parses SKILL.md frontmatter/steps/safety rules, executes steps with gate validation, emits events (29 self-tests passing)
- **`forge_run_skill` MCP tool** — execute any skill programmatically with dry-run mode, hub event broadcasting, and structured results

### Added — API Provider Abstraction & Quorum Analysis
- **API provider registry** — pattern-based model routing via `API_PROVIDERS` config. Models matching `/^grok-/` auto-route to xAI API via `callApiWorker()`. Extensible to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **xAI Grok support** — `grok-4.20`, `grok-4`, `grok-3`, `grok-3-mini` available via `api.x.ai`. Requires `XAI_API_KEY` env var. Pricing integrated into cost tracking
- **`detectWorkers()` enhancement** — now reports both CLI workers (`gh-copilot`, `claude`, `codex`) and API workers (`api-xai`) with `type: "cli"|"api"` field
- **`spawnWorker()` API routing** — automatically routes API-backed models through HTTP before falling back to CLI workers
- **`forge_diagnose` MCP tool** — multi-model bug investigation. Dispatches file analysis to N models independently, then synthesizes root cause analysis with fix recommendations
- **`pforge diagnose <file> --models m1,m2` CLI command** — programmatic multi-model bug investigation from the command line
- **`forge_analyze` quorum enhancements** — `quorum` (boolean), `mode` (plan/file), and `models` (custom model list) parameters for multi-model consensus analysis
- **`pforge analyze --quorum --mode --models` CLI flags** — quorum consistency scoring with explicit mode and model overrides
- **`/code-review --quorum` skill** — all 5 preset code-review skills updated for multi-model code review via quorum infrastructure
- **`analyzeWithQuorum()`** — new orchestrator function supporting plan/file/diagnose modes with parallel model dispatch and reviewer synthesis
- **Grok model pricing** — grok-4.20 ($3/$15), grok-4 ($2/$10), grok-3 ($3/$15), grok-3-mini ($0.30/$0.50) per million tokens

### Fixed
- **UTF-8 BOM** — `pforge.ps1`, `setup.ps1`, `validate-setup.ps1` now have UTF-8 BOM for Windows PowerShell 5.1 compatibility (em-dashes, arrows, checkmarks, box-drawing were corrupted without BOM)

---

## [2.5.0] — 2026-04-05

### Added — Quorum Mode (Multi-Model Consensus)
- **Quorum dispatch** — fan out slice to 3 AI models (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.3-Codex, Gemini 3.1 Pro) in parallel dry-run sessions, each producing a detailed implementation plan without executing code
- **Quorum reviewer** — synthesis agent merges dry-run responses into a unified execution plan, picking the best approach per file/component
- **Complexity scoring** — `scoreSliceComplexity()` rates slices 1-10 based on 7 weighted signals: file scope count, cross-module dependencies, security keywords, database/migration keywords, gate count, task count, and historical failure rate
- **Quorum auto mode** — `--quorum=auto` triggers quorum only for slices scoring ≥ threshold (default: 7). Low-complexity slices run normally, saving tokens
- **CLI flags** — `--quorum` (force all slices), `--quorum=auto` (threshold-based), `--quorum-threshold N` (override threshold)
- **MCP tool** — `forge_run_plan` accepts `quorum` ("false"/"true"/"auto") and `quorumThreshold` parameters
- **Config** — `.forge.json` `quorum` block: `enabled`, `auto`, `threshold`, `models[]`, `reviewerModel`, `dryRunTimeout`
- **Cost tracking** — tokens tracked per dry-run leg + reviewer + execution. `--estimate --quorum` shows overhead breakdown
- **Telemetry** — quorum legs modeled as CLIENT child spans in `trace.json`; events: `quorum-dispatch-started`, `quorum-leg-completed`, `quorum-review-completed`
- **Graceful degradation** — <2 successful dry-runs falls back to normal execution. Reviewer failure uses best single response
- **Capabilities** — `quorum-execute` workflow, quorum config in schema, 6 new glossary terms, updated CLI examples
- **83 self-tests** passing (was 65), including complexity scoring + config tests

## [2.4.0] — 2026-04-05

### Added — Unified Telemetry
- **`pforge-mcp/telemetry.mjs`** — OTLP-compatible trace/span/log capture. Every run produces `trace.json` with resource context, span kinds (SERVER/INTERNAL/CLIENT), severity levels, and log summaries.
- **Log Registry** — per-run `manifest.json` + global `index.jsonl` (append-only, corruption-tolerant). Dashboard reads index for instant run listing.
- **Dashboard Traces tab** — waterfall timeline with span detail panel, severity filters (All/Errors/Warnings), span attributes viewer
- **REST API** — `GET /api/traces` (list runs from index), `GET /api/traces/:runId` (trace detail)
- **Log rotation** — `maxRunHistory` config in `.forge.json` (default: 50), auto-prunes oldest runs

## [2.3.0] — 2026-04-05

### Added — Machine-Readable API Surface
- **`forge_capabilities`** MCP tool (14th tool) — returns full capability surface: enriched tools with semantic metadata, CLI schema, workflow graphs, config schema, dashboard info
- **`pforge-mcp/capabilities.mjs`** — enriched metadata for all 14 tools: intent tags, prerequisites, produces/consumes, side effects, cost hints, error catalog with recovery hints
- **Workflow graphs** — 4 tool-chaining sequences: execute-plan, diagnose-project, plan-and-execute, review-run
- **`tools.json` + `cli-schema.json`** — auto-generated on server startup (always in sync)
- **`.well-known/plan-forge.json`** — HTTP discovery endpoint + `GET /api/capabilities` REST equivalent
- **Operational metadata** — version compatibility, deprecation signals, rate limit hints, operation ID aliases

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-04

### Added — Autonomous Execution (v2.0)
- **`forge_run_plan`** MCP tool + `pforge run-plan` CLI command — one-command plan execution with DAG-based slice orchestration, `gh copilot` CLI worker spawning, validation gates at every boundary, token tracking from JSONL output, model routing from `.forge.json`, auto-sweep + auto-analyze, session log capture, cost estimation, and resume-from support
- **`forge_abort`** MCP tool — signal abort between slices during plan execution
- **`forge_plan_status`** MCP tool — read latest run status from `.forge/runs/`
- **`forge_cost_report`** MCP tool — cost tracking report with total spend, per-model breakdown, and monthly aggregation from `.forge/cost-history.json`
- **Cost calculation engine** — per-slice cost from token counts using embedded model pricing table (23 models), cost breakdown in `summary.json`, cost history aggregation across runs
- **Historical estimation** — `--estimate` uses historical average tokens per slice when cost history exists, falls back to heuristic; shows confidence level
- **WebSocket Hub** (`pforge-mcp/hub.mjs`) — real-time event broadcasting for live progress monitoring. Localhost-only WS server (port 3101) with port fallback, heartbeat, session registry, event history buffer (last 100 events), versioned events (v1.0)
- **Event Schema** (`pforge-mcp/EVENTS.md`) — documented event types: `run-started`, `slice-started`, `slice-completed`, `slice-failed`, `run-completed`, `run-aborted`
- **Live orchestrator events** — when hub is running, `forge_run_plan` broadcasts slice lifecycle events to all connected WebSocket clients in real-time
- **Dashboard** (`pforge-mcp/dashboard/`) — real-time monitoring UI at `localhost:3100/dashboard`. Vanilla JS + Tailwind CDN + Chart.js. No build step. Features: live slice progress cards, run history table, cost tracker with charts, quick actions panel (Smith, Sweep, Analyze, Status, Validate, Extensions)
- **REST API** — Express endpoints: `GET /api/status`, `GET /api/runs`, `GET /api/config`, `POST /api/config`, `GET /api/cost`, `POST /api/tool/:name`, `GET /api/hub`, `GET /api/replay/:run/:slice`
- **Session Replay** — dashboard tab to browse and filter agent session logs per slice (errors, file ops, full log)
- **Extension Marketplace UI** — visual catalog browser with search/filter
- **Notification Center** — bell icon with persistent notifications (localStorage), auto-notifies on run-complete and slice-failed
- **Config Editor** — visual editor for `.forge.json` (agents, model routing) with save confirmation
- **Parallel Execution** — `[P]`-tagged slices execute concurrently via `ParallelScheduler` (up to configurable `maxParallelism`, default: 3). DAG-aware: respects dependencies, merge points, and scope-based conflict detection
- **Scope Conflict Detection** — warns and falls back to sequential when parallel slices have overlapping file scopes
- **Execution modes** — Full Auto (`gh copilot` CLI with any model) and Assisted (human codes in VS Code, orchestrator validates gates)
- **`.forge/SCHEMA.md`** — documents all `.forge/` files with formats, schemas, and ownership

---

## [Unreleased — v1.3.0]

### Added
- **`pforge smith`** — Forge-themed diagnostic command that inspects environment, VS Code config, setup health, version currency, and common problems with actionable FIX suggestions (PowerShell + Bash parity)
- **Plan Forge Validate GitHub Action** (`srnichols/plan-forge-validate@v1`) — Composite action for CI plan validation: setup health, file counts, placeholders, orphan detection, plan artifacts, completeness sweep
- **Multi-agent support** — `-Agent` (PowerShell) / `--agent` (Bash) parameter on setup scripts. Supports `claude`, `cursor`, `codex`, or `all` alongside the default Copilot files
  - Claude Code: rich `CLAUDE.md` (project context + all 16 guardrail files embedded by domain) + `.claude/skills/` (all prompts + all reviewer agents as invocable skills)
  - Cursor: rich `.cursor/rules` (project context + all guardrails) + `.cursor/commands/` (all prompts + all reviewer agents as commands)
  - Codex CLI: `.agents/skills/` (all prompts + all reviewer agents as skills)
  - Smart guardrail instructions emulate Copilot's auto-loading, post-edit scanning, and forbidden path checking
- `.forge.json` now records configured agents in an `agents` field
- `pforge smith` detects and validates agent-specific file paths
- **MCP Server** (`pforge-mcp/server.mjs`) — Node.js MCP server exposing 14 forge tools. Auto-generates `.vscode/mcp.json` and `.claude/mcp.json` during setup. Composable with OpenBrain.
- **Extension ecosystem** — `pforge ext search`, `pforge ext add <name>`, `pforge ext info <name>` commands with `extensions/catalog.json` community catalog (Spec Kit catalog-compatible format)
- **Cross-artifact analysis** (`pforge analyze`) — Consistency scoring across requirements, scope, tests, and validation gates. Four dimensions (traceability, coverage, test coverage, gates) scored 0–100. CI integration via `plan-forge-validate@v1` with `analyze` input.
- **Spec Kit comparison FAQ** — Honest side-by-side guidance on when to use Spec Kit vs Plan Forge

---

## [1.2.2] — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **`azure-iac` preset** — Azure Bicep / Terraform / PowerShell / azd with 12 IaC-specific instruction files: `bicep`, `terraform`, `powershell`, `azd`, `naming`, `security`, `testing`, `deploy`, `waf`, `caf`, `landing-zone`, `policy`
- **`azure-sweeper` agent** — 8-layer enterprise governance sweep: WAF → CAF → Landing Zone → Policy → Org Rules → Resource Graph → Telemetry → Remediation codegen
- **WAF / CAF / Landing Zone / Policy instruction files** — Azure Well-Architected Framework, Cloud Adoption Framework, and Azure Landing Zone baselines; Azure Policy enforcement rules
- **3 azure-iac skills** — `/infra-deploy`, `/infra-test`, `/azure-sweep` slash commands
- **5 azure-iac agents** — `bicep-reviewer`, `terraform-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, `deploy-helper`, `azure-sweeper`
- **6 azure-iac scaffolding prompts** — `new-bicep-module`, `new-terraform-module`, `new-pester-test`, `new-pipeline`, `new-azd-service`, `new-org-rules`
- **`azure-infrastructure` example extension** — for mixed app+infra repos using the `azure-iac` preset as an extension
- **Multi-preset support** — `setup.ps1 -Preset dotnet,azure-iac` and `setup.sh --preset dotnet,azure-iac` apply multiple presets in one pass; first preset sets `copilot-instructions.md` and `AGENTS.md`, subsequent presets add their unique files
- **`pforge.sh update`** — full `cmd_update()` bash implementation mirroring `pforge.ps1` `Invoke-Update`, with SHA256 hash comparison, preset-aware new-file delivery, and `--dry-run`/`--force` flags
- **Preset-aware `pforge update`** — both PS1 and SH update commands now deliver new preset-specific files (instructions, agents, prompts, skills) that don't yet exist in the project

### Fixed
- **Skills count corrected** — all presets ship with 8 skills (not 3); 5 additional skills (`dependency-audit`, `code-review`, `release-notes`, `api-doc-gen`, `onboarding`) were present in codebase but undocumented in counts
- **Instruction file count corrected** — 16 per app preset (not 15); `project-principles.instructions.md` was present but missing from totals (17 for TypeScript)
- **Prompt template count corrected** — 15 per app preset (not 14); `project-principles.prompt.md` was present but missing from count
- **Agent count corrected in AGENT-SETUP.md** — 18 per app preset installation (6 stack + 7 cross-stack + 5 pipeline), not 15
- **Update command preservation logic** — preset-aware update block now only ADDS new files; existing preset files (which may be user-customized) are never overwritten by either `pforge.ps1` or `pforge.sh`

### Changed
- `setup.ps1` and `setup.sh` wired for `azure-iac` auto-detection (`.bicep`, `bicepconfig.json`, `azure.yaml`, `*.tf` markers)
- `validate-setup.ps1` and `validate-setup.sh` have `azure-iac`-specific checks (`bicep.instructions.md`, `naming.instructions.md`, `deploy.instructions.md` instead of `database.instructions.md`)
- `AGENT-SETUP.md`, `docs/CLI-GUIDE.md`, README, CUSTOMIZATION.md, COPILOT-VSCODE-GUIDE.md all updated with correct counts, azure-iac tables, and multi-preset examples

---

## [1.2.1] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Claude Opus 4.6 prompt calibration** — softened aggressive STOP/MUST/HALT language across all pipeline prompts; Claude 4.6 is more responsive to instructions and overtriggers on aggressive phrasing
- **Few-shot examples in Step 0** — strong and weak specification examples (in `<examples>` tags) teach the model what good specs look like
- **MUST/SHOULD/MAY acceptance criteria** — structured format in Step 0 makes criteria mechanically testable and directly translatable to validation gates
- **Complexity estimation routing** — Step 0 now classifies work as Micro/Small/Medium/Large and recommends whether to skip, light-harden, or run the full pipeline
- **XML-structured spec output** — optional machine-readable `<specification>` block in Step 0 output for unambiguous downstream parsing
- **Plan quality self-check** — 7-point checklist in Step 2 catches broken plans before they enter execution (missing validation gates, unresolved TBDs, untraceable criteria)
- **Anti-hallucination directive** — `<investigate_before_coding>` block in Step 3 prevents the agent from assuming file contents without reading them
- **Anti-overengineering guard** — `<implementation_discipline>` block in Step 3 prevents adding features, abstractions, or error handling beyond what the slice requires
- **Context budget awareness** — slice templates now guide authors to list only domain-relevant instruction files (not all 15), reducing context window consumption
- **Lightweight re-anchor option** — 4 yes/no questions by default, full re-anchor every 3rd slice or on violation; saves ~500-1,000 tokens per clean slice
- **Session budget check** — Step 2 now flags plans with 8+ slices for session break points and slices with 5+ context files for trimming
- **Memory capture protocol** — Step 6 (Ship) now saves conventions, lessons learned, and forbidden patterns to `/memories/repo/` so future phases avoid past mistakes
- **Memory loading in Step 2** — hardening now reads `/memories/repo/` for prior phase lessons before scoping and slicing decisions
- **Claude 4.6 tuning section** — added to CUSTOMIZATION.md with guidance for over-halting, over-exploring, overengineering, context budgets, and effort parameter settings
- **Recommended plan template ordering** — Scope Contract and Stop Conditions first in hardened plans (most-referenced sections at top improves long-context performance)

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Project Principles** — workshop prompt with 3 paths: interview, starter sets, codebase discovery
- **External Specification Support** — optional spec source field in Scope Contract with traceability

- **CLI Guide** — `docs/CLI-GUIDE.md` with dual-audience (human + AI agent) documentation
- **Extensions Guide** — `docs/EXTENSIONS.md` with structure, manifest, distribution channels
- **Lifecycle Hooks** — `.github/hooks/plan-forge.json` with SessionStart (inject principles), PreToolUse (enforce Forbidden Actions), PostToolUse (warn on TODO/FIXME markers)
- **Skill Slash Commands** — all 3 skills now have proper frontmatter for `/database-migration`, `/staging-deploy`, `/test-sweep` invocation
- **5 New Skills** — `/dependency-audit`, `/code-review`, `/release-notes`, `/api-doc-gen`, `/onboarding` (8 total per preset)
- **2 New Shared Agents** — `dependency-reviewer.agent.md` (supply chain security) and `compliance-reviewer.agent.md` (GDPR/CCPA/SOC2)
- **Agents vs Skills explainer** — README now explains the difference with comparison table
- **Auto-format hook** — PostToolUse auto-runs project formatter (dotnet format, prettier, ruff, gofmt) after every file edit
- **`pforge commit`** — auto-generates conventional commit messages from slice goals
- **`pforge phase-status`** — updates roadmap status icons without manual editing
- **Setup wizard asks for build/test/lint commands** — eliminates placeholder editing step
- **Stop hook** — warns when agent session ends with code changes but no test run detected
- **`pforge sweep`** — scan code files for TODO/FIXME/stub/placeholder markers from terminal
- **`pforge diff`** — compare changed files against plan's Scope Contract for drift detection
- **Monorepo FAQ** — documents `chat.useCustomizationsInParentRepositories` setting
- **Agent Plugin Packaging** — `plugin.json` at repo root for `Chat: Install Plugin From Source` installation
- **VS Code Checkpoints** — added as Option 0 in Rollback Protocol for beginners
